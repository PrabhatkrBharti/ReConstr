I don't see how your approach has potential to shed light on a question that anyone might have.,N
"It is a bit strange for me that authors have used Python for statistical analysis instead of SPSS or MATLAB as usual. Please, explain",C
The paper could be considered for acceptance given a rewrite of the paper and change in the title and abstract.,C
Reviewer 2: The proposal is also poorly written and unfocused with only brief moments of meritorious thinking.,N
The scientific contribution of this paper - if there is any at all - is at best hopelessly insignificant.,N
But there have been treatments along these exact lines that are uncited: [A fictional novel about a hypothetical war] and [an op-ed in the Washington Post].,N
"So overall we do not recommend a resubmission, but can let you try if you insist",N
"This discussion might be better directed to a different audience, perhaps an undergraduate class",N
"In my opinion, this is a fundamental wrong approach.",N
This paper makes no contribution.,N
"The applicant does not address the broader impacts of the proposal, other than its potential benefit to global human health.",C
My major concern to accept this work-in-progress paper is that these findings are not super interesting to readers in my opinion.,C
"But fundamentally, why did you bother?",N
The proposal is also poorly written and unfocused with only brief moments of meritorious thinking,N
This work is antithetical to the spirit of [XX research] and will impede potentially important developments.,C
Your discipline doesn't exist,N
"However, bad language, weird sentences, half true statements and even nonsense statements continue throughout the draft, I refuse to review more of this draft until these language issues get fixed properly.",C
"Publication of this paper will not advance our knowledge in any shape of form, it will just result in other researchers pointing out how bad this study actually is",N
"I have read this MS twice, which given the grammatical howlers in the Abstract would appear to be more times than it has been read by the authors. Given the lack of proof-reading and my concern over the methods used, I shall not comment beyond the end of the methods section, and shall comment selectively rather than exhaustively (which would indeed be exhausting).",C
I am personally offended that the authors believed that this study had a reasonable chance of being accepted to a serious scientific journal.,N
Did you have a seizure while writing this sentence? Because I feel like I had one while reading it.,N
"While the authors do pick a good problem, that's where the quality of the paper ends for me.",N
I started reading this manuscript with much anticipation but my enthusiasm was short lived.,N
This result would be great if it were true,N
This is a sin of omission!,N
"The result does improve the state-of-the-art, but it is not strong enough for acceptance",N
I would advise the authors to go back to the drawing board and consider exactly what this paper is trying to do and do this well.,N
"Yes measurements were made, but why, besides a teaching exercise, remains obscure.",N
The authors are amateurs,N
"In any aspect that this paper is different from XXX et al., (20XX), it shouldn't be",N
The first sentence is unfortunate,N
This paper is very weak.,N
"When the reader is finished struggling through all the methods and results, he/she is left wondering whether it was worth the time.",N
"There is hardly any paragraph (even in the abstract) that is not messy, disorganized, confusing, that does not contain mistakes (some are quite embarrassing), redundancies, abusive shortcuts or discussions that sound absurd",N
"Frankly, she knows nothing about invasion biology or the Great Lakes and should stick with what she does know.",N
My summary assessment of the paper is as follows:Introduction: PoorBackground: PoorMethods: PoorResults: PoorDiscussion: PoorConclusions: Poor Overall assessment: PoorRecommendation: RejectFurther Comments: Why was this submitted to a journal?,N
The presentation of the paper is difficult to follow for a hard scientist and it sometimes reads as if it were machine generated.,N
"Most part of 'methodology' is useless, most of paragraphs are inrelevant to the main topics.",C
"Sometimes I am diplomatic and sometimes critical, but this time I am resolute. I fail to see the contribution either to physics or social science.",N
"This is a very difficult paper to review, and difficult - even painful - to read",N
"XX is inserted purely for fashion, adds nothing, and reflects the authors' belief/wish that fashionable papers regardless of logic or content have a larger chance of acceptance. Our community needs to combat this sort of unreflexive pseudo-scholarship.",N
Perhaps what I have written is deflating.,N
I am sorry but this paper does not leave me satisfied,N
"I had no idea what this concept was until reading your paper, but your abstract wouldn't have made me want to read it had I not been a reviewer",C
The experimental design is a bit funny,C
"I cannot make out signs of independent thinking, work beyond the state of the art, or anything ground-breaking.",N
This reviewer was a bit concerned about the results section given that it appears that participants in the current study were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions,N
claiming 'insights' that rarely amount to very much beyond the bleeding obvious. [..] the problem with jargon is that 'any idiot can pick it up and have a go,N
The results are as weak as a wet noodle,N
The manuscript embarrassingly fails in addressing the declared aims.,N
"There are two possibilities. 1) This paper is part of an experiment to try and determine how badly a research paper can be but still be accepted, or 2) The authors are actual fools and it would be in the editor's best interest to ban them from submitting to the journal in the future.",N
"I am, frankly, underwhelmed by the revisions. Most of the responses sound smooth, but really just written to avoid serious additional work.",N
I do not want to see the paper again.,N
This paper is absolutely ridiculous. It shouldn't be published anywhere and the author should not be encouraged to revise.,N
"Finally, I have substantial criticisms, in addition to the disappointment of seeing hoary old chestnuts",N
"Table 4 seems unnecessary given figure 8. Indeed, figure 8 also seems unnecessary.",C
The English language ranks this manuscript among the top 5 worst manuscripts I have ever reviewed,N
there is no evidence to show this is the first paper to propose the idea,C
The writing is not at school level,N
"An exercise in feature manipulation, of the brainless kind",N
I apologize for this but frankly some parts read like a report of a high-school student on a scientific experiment.,N
There is no need to test these hypotheses. They have been tested a long time ago. It is in all textbooks.,C
This would seem to constitute the very minimum basic scientific requirement for attempting to publish a body of (unoriginal) data,N
"The entire paper reads a bit like someone who has searched around the social scientific research literature without much authentic understanding of social science, social scientific research methodology, or statistical analyses",C
"Which means that, as the saying goes, if their results are correct they cannot be new, and if they are “new” they cannot possibly be correct.Frankly, it is hard to say which is the case",N
I am not convinced if any clear real value of this research.,N
This [sentence] construction should be reserved for police procedurals and bad Mafia movies.,N
"The authors are perpetuating misguided generalizations in the face of substantial
 
 
 experimental data to the contrary",C
"There are also other points that have to be addressed, but considering the current state of the manuscript, I do not think it is makes sense to go into further detail.",N
"It is very lengthy, full of mistakes, irrelevant information, and completely fails to attract readers.",N
Why chase a gene in this ridiculous organism?,N
Future work: The authors' personal research agenda is irrelevant here.,N
Line 306. The sentence follows a bit of a Yoda-esque grammar,N
I just don't get the point of this,N
I suggest you consult a competent statistical advisor.,N
It is more of a blog post than a research article,N
The sum total is frustration with what I can only call cavalier treatment of promising material.,N
With the appropriate revisions these results could provide a very limited contribution to the field.,N
I have rarely read a more blown-up and annoying paper in the last couple of years than this hot-air balloon manuscript,N
This paper introduces tools to answer questions which it does not seem many people are interested in,N
"In a nutshell, please cut out all the hype, show some integrity, and write a balanced paper.",C
The first problem is that the method - whatever it is and however it works - is insufficiently evaluated.,C
"Since the paper is mathematically empty and, compared with the conference version, provides no new ideas or findings,
 
 
 in general, I see no reason why it should be published in a journal as well.",C
Figure 6. This figure is silly.,C
Various statements seem to be sweeping and inaccurate generalizations with little robust justification,C
The manuscript reads much like an unrevised masters level paper.,N
"You do not use the empirical data for the analysis, but the empirical data uses you",N
"The candidate demonstrates no understanding of the subject matter and his proposal title is misleading. Furthermore, his career prospects are unclear.",N
"Since the manuscript is so lacking in all aspects, I won't bother going through it in detail.",N
"The author does not exhibit adequate acquaintance with the subject under discussion, the scholarship on it, the structure of logical argument, or the writing of English.",C
"Publishable, but why?",N
"I believe that the authors have done scientific work, but in the current form of the paper it is impossible to judge it.",N
"The color rainbow is pretty, but largely useless.",N
The authors report results from pages 16-26. This section reflects what I would brutally call 'death by figures',N
I cannot possibly imagine what could have led the authors to believe that their paper was remotely interesting enough to submit for publication.,N
Usually climate studies do not show a good method for the proposed research. This is one of them.,N
This is starting to feel like a book report,N
"If the editor somehow decides to accept this paper, they risk permanently destroying the credibility of this journal and its entire editorial board.",N
"Right now, there is zero rationale for the study and zero reason to read the study.",N
Details of how important these effects are are missing. Ref.75 is entertaining but inadequate in this respect.,C
It is essentially an opinion piece that editorializes shamelessly about the superior methods of a recent paper in the first person,N
I have difficulties identifying the aim and added value of the present study to this topic.,C
"The experiments are reasonable, but they fail the fundamental test of good science",N
I regret to inform you that our journal will not be able to publish your work. We contacted meanwhile 16 (sixteen!) reviewers of which 12 (twelve) did not respond positively (the others did not answer our queries).,N
Your proposed method should be compared with another method that introduced in a prestigious paper'[full review],C
Appears to be on the perimeter of meaningful investigation.,N
The rest of the Introduction is just as badly done as the first paragraph so I will not continue,N
This article is on an interesting topic. Unfortunately there is no more positive to say about this manuscript.,N
The study is poorly conceived and inadequately conducted and the conclusions made by the authors do not necessarily follow from the results,N
It reads more like a diagnosis confirmed by a set of examples,N
"Thus, there is nothing new in the manuscript that warrants publication in Science or most other scientific journals.",N
"Recommendation: Publish elsewhere
 
 
 Comments: [none]",N
It is safe to say that the authors want to see their paper published more than I really want to reject it,N
"The work is trivial, and there is no novelty in the work, the approach or the results. The authors do not solve anything and the implications in this context are quite possibly irrelevant.",C
I am sorry if I am missing something obvious here but this is not my area of work.,N
"First, the paper is for a large part incomprehensible",N
The paper is presented as a rather undigestible and tortuous collection of disparate results,N
Such a prestigious journal can surely make better use of its limited space.,N
"The paper comes with proofs, but – at a first glance – they seem to be more cute than useful.",N
"It is hard to imagine researchers of this caliber being unaware of a half-century the field x, especially as concerns the bulk of what they have done in this paper.",N
"I was really looking forward to reading this manuscript, however this enthusiasm soon waned.",N
You are trying to do too much and end up accomplishing too little. It is a collection of good ideas that do not add up to or advance to any meaningful conclusion.,N
I felt like I was reading a horror movie - the scene where our protagonist leaves the door unlocked and says 'let's split up' to his/her comrades. and you know doom is surely going to reach our protagonist soon.,N
"That's not possible to do without mind-reading, and there's nothing in the Method section about mind-reading methods",N
"And the Vygotsky reference is a straight-up drive-by citation, adding nothing except whatever luster he adds to the authors' claims.",N
"By now, there are over 1,000 [articles on this topic], but these authors have not read a single one.",N
"How does [redacted theory] explain your results? Or really, your underwhelming results?",N
"While this study represents a substantial amount of work, it is not all that clear why the work was done.",N
I wish I could explain what is the purpose of the manuscript.,N
It seems that the author is simply engaged in proprietary phrase coining - advancing a new term for a well-researched phenomenon,N
"The team has generated the kind of gaudy, brobdignagian dataset that makes it such a curious and exciting time",N
So many electrons worked so very very hard on this paper,N
The discussion is inappropriate and the new content is generally poorly written,N
It just doesn't make sense.,N
"In a nutshell, I am not sure if the problem is indeed a challenge or just a fact that we have to live with, such as gravity or death, for which no solutions exist.",N
"Moreover, it is unclear whether the effect is sufficiently important to warrant replication.",N
It is worth saying that I am not convinced that you contribute to the evidence base in this paper.,N
That's not how science is done.,N
The authors conclusions not only contradict their own data but also the laws of thermodynamics,C
"I really don't like to be harsh in my reviews, but ...",N
However I deplore the fact that this paper has been created at all,N
"While I think there is good reason to have performed this work, it does make for unexciting reading.",N
"Authors wanted to make title catchy but actually finished trivial title, a la 'Daily mail'",N
"While the problem is a very important one for modern society, the topic and lessons are not of broad interest.",C
"Line 156-160; this is the only correct, sensible and interesting finding of the paper.",N
It feels a little bit like someone wanting to run a series of statistics.,N
Simply conducting the same analyses in a different data set does not equate novelty or impact to the field.,N
"Are the '10 random reps"" chosen at random?",C
The authors need to add a level of puzzlement to their interpretations,N
One wonders whether the analysis was an exercise in using a cannon to open an unlocked door.,N
This work is only a maths game.,N
"Overall, I think this manuscript is a waste of time.",N
"Moreover, it is very difficult to see the actual contribution this manuscript will have",N
The abstract is intriguing but confusing,C
"I guess this proposal could be interesting, if you're interested in this obscure sect of biology",N
I don't understand thermodynamics.,N
"A great deal of effort has been expended here, but to what end?",N
This paper is desperate. Please reject it completely and then block the author's email ID so they can't use the online system in the future.,N
The Discussion section of the paper is neither informative nor enlightening and is certainly theoretically questionably,C
The word 'asses' should read 'assess',C
"Cite newer, relevant references, especially those published by X 2012, and X 2008. Best wishes, Dr. X, Associate Editor",C
Intermediary steps and the apologetics for [topic x] derived from an ahistorical cult and its author.,C
The team is very experienced. It [the paper] felt a bit less self referential than they often are,C
"Sorry for our long silence, due to some perplexity on our side at reading your manuscript.",N
I recommend the publication even if I am not impressed,N
"If the author is comfortable having his/her name on this paper, then I won't stand in the way of its publication.",N
I am impatient with this vague assertion.,N
The length of this review is occasioned by the density of error and misconceived arguments in this manuscript. As a service primarily to the authors I have decided to actually try to convey a sense of the extreme nature of the problems encumbering this submission.,C
"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this paper for publication because its contents violate the laws of physics",C
"The authors are permitted to believe what they want to, but the data did not support 'important implications.",C
"However, the applicant seems to have run out of steam before he developed a detailed plan for the proposed research and then completed the proposal. This is unfortunate.",N
This book has more mistakes than a hound has fleas,C
I did not attempt to understand Figure 2 because there was no motivation given for it,C
"It looks to be more of a chance for the authors to promote a product using a poorly constructed, non-replicable pilot study",N
In order to be able to publish this manuscript it need [sic] to be rewritten in the form of a scientific article,C
"Through a streamlining of the argument, meaningful references to existing literature and a restriction to the essentials, the manuscript may still be saved",C
This sentence is so hard to digest it gave me reflux,C
I also thing that the English of the manuscript need further polishing.,C
Several books that are cited but there is no evidence that they have ever been studied and understood.,C
It is difficult from this reviewer's perspective to even call these studies.,N
The take home message has to be extracted with significant labor from a punishing set of figures with multiple bar graphs.,C
"suggesting much but saying nothing of import, the sort of balderdash that is in the vernacular often compared to the waste of certain male ruminants.",C
"What, then, is the point of this manuscript, which presents no truly new data, methods, conclusions, or arguments? I would venture that it has no raison d'etre, and is neither novel nor helpful.",C
this may eventually be a cited paper.,C
"Ugh. Read a book. This is grossly oversimplified, and not an appropriate statement for a scientific journal.",N
I would have preferred to read a meta-analysis,N
"This article describes [XY], a research project investigating methods for educational game design. The paper is poorly written"".[full review]",N
"Even if other readers found it comprehensible, there is not even a proposed path to make [this model] into a modeling system.",C
The paper was so boring I fell asleep halfway through,N
"The system described in the manuscript is inherently confusing. Despite re-reading, its basic elements did not make sense.",C
"High was my expectation, and so much deeper was my disappointment",N
To my mind the question [the paper is about] is similar to to the medieval debate concerning angels dancing on pinheads. I do not think the paper should be published.,N
This paper is written.,N
Your research paper is not motivated. There is no motivation behind your algorithm. Your results lack motivation.,C
In other words: the referee thinks this work is stuck in the past. The referee would rather talk about the future - some of the senior co-authors were the future once!,N
The results section is not great (boring).,C
This made the paper very long and may bore the reader,C
The study is largely descriptive in nature and mostly a fishing expedition. It will be great if they catch some interesting or unexpected fish.,C
The manuscript is a collection of fragmented and disconnected descriptive observations.,C
"This is clearly a submission that needs to be shredded, burned, and the ashes buried in multiple locations",N
I think the audience will eat him alive. But I want to be there to hear it.,N
The current manuscript is deceptive and I do not recommend its publication.,C
"There is an over-reliance on sophisticated statistics at the expense of good old fashioned, scientific thought",C
The title is the closest I've seen to manuscript clickbait,C
"This manuscript uses half of the available pages, and fails to explain what has
 
 
 been done, how and why",C
I would like to urge the authors to improve the language description to make the manuscript much clear and logic. A professional language expert is recommended to use,C
This section gives the impression that you'll throw a handful of darts at a target and see what you happen to hit.,N
It seems like you are torturing the data until the model converges.,C
The chapter is too scholarly and too casual,N
(after having cited an author) 'one could call this name-dropping,N
Unfortunately I was hoping for more.,N
Lots of hand waving in this Discussion,N
In the experimental part there is a lack of scientific by taking over results from reference literature.,C
I find myself disagreeing with most of this papers conclusions,N
The writer of the manuscript is utterly ridiculous and appears to believe they will solve poverty through radio astronomy.,N
Having read through this a couple of times I have ended up feeling rather depressed.,N
Reviewer #1: 'The project can hardly be described as high risk/high gain',C
Reviewer #3: 'The project is clearly high risk/high gain,C
The english languish should be improved,C
"The manuscript is too long for what the authors have to say. However, additional text is required as outlined below",C
"Fig 3e is fanciful, verging on silly",C
"Being the first is not the best motivation. For example, I could be the first one to jump of the SBE building with a triple back flip and no safety net. I'd be the first (I think) and it would even be quite spectacular (I'm sure), but that doesn't make it a good idea.",N
"They have addressed most of the reviewer comments, although their responses to a few of them remind me of Donald Trump.",N
The way the study is framed here and in the main body comes off as straw-mannish.,C
The abstract is ok in the context of a weak manuscript,C
The paper is an old fashioned one,N
I feel the results are insufficiently counter-intuitive to warrant publication in [fancy journal],C
An alternative to counting sheep.,N
"Most of the work is methodological rather than scientific, making it somewhat boring.",C
"The underlying science here is quite interesting, but the presentation does its best to disguise it",C
This paper is about combining inflexible specifications in a flexible way.,C
The investigator is in the top 50% of his field,N
"Focus on limitations, because they are many!",C
"The paper descends into nonsense, never to return, on line 44.",C
"It is at best of little value and, in the worst case, irrelevant
 
 
 and offensive",N
"The scales appear to be not divided into quartiles as stated, but rather are based on the distribution of the data (into quartiles).",C
I find the title and the main premise of the abstract confusing and illogical. [key concept X] has the logic of a Monty Python sketch,C
"The data you have are weak, based on very small samples, not clear that they were analyzed properly, and are based on measurements taken in the wrong medium for the organisms. I see little of value in this paper.",C
This manuscript is not publishable in a reasonable sense,N
is 'bisexuals' referring to the entire sample or those who identify solely as bisexual?,C
You should consider consulting a competent statistical adviser.,C
"the correlations are not that strong (e.g., p = .022)",C
This work is not an easy topic.,N
"The first problem in the 'Theoretical Analysis' section is trivial and requires no analysis, as any sensible schoolkid can identify its solution.",C
..incoherent babble of unsubstantiated overstatement.,N
The supportive tone of this review... took some effort.,N
"The biggest problem with this manuscript, which has nearly sucked the will to live out of me, is the terrible writing style.",C
This is a paper struggling not to die,N
This manuscript is obviously not suitable for publication in high impact factor journals.,N
Pity about the main thesis.,C
"And finally comes the conclusion, which is the intellectual equivalent of bubblegum.",C
"This is a well-intentioned but naïve and unscholarly presentation of a point of view that is not well-supported by evidence – a polemic, not a review",C
I really want to like this study.,N
"The citations of those two writers are cursory, almost impressionistic (in the negative sense of the term).",C
This paper is so bad I cannot even reject it!,N
The novelty is my most concern,C
I find this submission confusingly and not always grammatically written. The aims and objectives seem rather muddled. References are rather sparse.,C
The results are new but were predictable.,C
"There are numerous problems with this paper, starting with the title.",C
The authors should take the time to thoroughly refine and revise manuscripts before they are sent to innocent reviewers.,C
"The paper is overlong, very verbose and contains unnecessary repetition.",C
It would be wholly inappropriate to randomize living people to an intervention.,N
Ah-now I see a glimpse of promise in this paper,N
I'm a bonehead so maybe I missed this?,N
"Reading this paper, I am struck by the elegance and clarity of the writing and the ideas. I found myself thinking, “such a simple and obvious idea — why didn’t I think of that?",N
There are a bunch of other things going on that could be spuriously related.,C
"My disappointment when finding flawed analyses, conclusions, and terminology [..] was therefore substantial",C
It is rather clear that the paper is incomplete and hastily submitted. Note that you failed to provide the contribution number in the acknowledgements. The paper is NOT COMPLETE',C
"In the list of authors, one wonders whether these authors read the manuscript",N
"Sorry guys, I'm throwing in the towel.",N
"This lack of familiarity with the literature is admittedly a bit unnerving, but hey that's what peer-reviews are for",C
Nobody in their right mind would ever suggest such a model,C
The authors avoid making mistakes in the analysis of the data by not making any.,C
Probably switching to Bayesian stats will be too difficult for many scientists and especially students in the less intelligent fields (e.g. psych),C
"Please, also perform spell checking and proof-reading. Too much of typos!",C
The original study was published in PsycScience. This is just some work by a grad student. Reject.,N
"Not now, not ever",N
"‘Qualitative tracing, correlational variables’ – what are they?",C
Why not [do the study] in vivo instead of in vitro?,C
Well written.,N
In my view the manuscript provides a relatively superficial summary of the area which lacks any attempt at interpretation or novelty. It is adequate only as a light topical treatment for a broad audience.,C
I find the author's writing to be very undergraduate-like.,C
"In summary, while I believe the work to be valid, timely, original and relevant, I am unable to see in what sense this work accords to the strict journal's criteria.",C
In my opinion they are overly reliant on statistical analyses and fail at times to actually see if the observed data agrees with the statistical evaluation.,C
This paper is too difficult for a journal on Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics,C
"This is a disaster. I could continue, but you see my point. You do seem to have a story in mind, but you do a poor job at presenting it.",C
"Can you explain this part a bit further, but without going into detail.",C
I concur with the reviewers that the methods are insufficient and thus the conclusion are totally overblown.,C
"The paper is definitely exploratory, but probably not of interest to people other than the author.",N
"There is a very interesting story to be conveyed in this paper. The problem is that this interesting story is hidden behind layers of mud, and it is obscured because the paper is poorly written and badly organised.",C
I do not have the background to assess the accuracy or to detect errors in the equations but I do not agree with this.,N
Perpetuating the recognition of this as a valid species in the face of irrefutable evidence is dilettantish and scientifically unacceptable,C
The authors are also treating what might be called a “boutique” version within a model that is already considered by many to be a “boutique” model.,C
The authors should discard the data and collect it again properly.,C
It is always rather pleasant to recommend that a paper be rejected.,N
"I urge the authors to not publish this article anywhere, as it will impede the progress of scientific understanding",N
Some papers are a pleasure to read. This is not one of them.,N
"I was originally very excited to review this paper, since such a bridge would span uncharted lands – here be dragons! High was my expectation, and so much deeper was my disappointment",C
Not good.,N
Why exactly this task? I can think of a zillion other cognitive tasks,N
"I am concerned that the survey data for this report were collected in 2005, 15 years ago.",C
This manuscript was neither enjoyable nor informative to read,N
"It's like you sat around and dreamed up ideas, except they're just castles in the air",N
I have reviewed many manuscripts in my career and I have never seen so many repeated mistakes of this type.,N
"As it is often the case with conceptual developments, most of it doesn't make a lot of sense, in the end",N
"This paper is baffling […] In particular, I have not looked at all at section 2 of the paper",C
"Written in parts like an experience track paper, minus the experience.",N
My first concern is that I don't get it.,N
The beekeeping example also fails to convince. There is no discussion of bees' actual lived experience.,C
The overall tenor is disturbingly glossy and pretentious given the gravity of the topic,C
None of the following comments on the original manuscript has been correctly reflected or answered,C
This looks like a work of pure fantasy.,N
There are far too many typos and grammatical mistakes. I started to correct these but got annoyed.,C
"In addition, I would suggest either activating the spellchecker on Word, or keeping the cat from walking on your keyboard. I think one of your words was previously employed as a Thunder in 'Finnegan's Wake",C
I now turn to my best guess about what the authors might be doing.,N
"The following discussion seems to ignore this major flaw, which turns mere arm-waving into Olympic-level calisthenics",C
"This paper was authored by a keen blogger and his colleagues. The paper perhaps reflects this informal approach, to its detriment.",N
Use of words like 'performativity' (is that a word?),C
"It is very well done, but sits somewhat in isolation from other schools of thought. It is -and I mean this with no disrespect to the author - a sort of echidna or platypus of a paper.",C
"[entire review] 'Research method is very important for an academic study; however, the reviewer cannot accept a paper without hypothesis, validity, reliability",C
I would drop the first clause in the paper title. It does nothing other than degrade the scientific integrity of the work.,C
"Quite frankly, it seems that the technical language is used more to frighten and take power over the reader rather than to facilitate the reader in his task, that should be to understand the results of the work (if there are any)",C
These snotty kids in quantum information,N
I would very much have liked to read the article promised in the abstract.,C
"Overall, the superheated sense of justification and self-advertising on display here are simply demeaning.",N
The conclusion drawn by the authors seems self explanatory and does not require any validation through the presented work,N
The reported mean of 7.7 is misleading because it appears that close to half of your participants are scoring below that mean,C
I don't know what to 'do' with this.,N
"Bad, very bad.",N
"This is madness, frankly, almost regardless of how it was implemented.",N
This left me somewhere between scratching my head and pulling my hair out,N
"If you aren't going to make to the effort to understand, then you should just give up",N
The map on the article is entirely unscientific. The data itself is also very dubious.,C

Reading this made my brain melt. Very true though.,N
The description of the participants is too cryptic.,C
I have followed the work of this group for the last few years and know that their submitted work is usually well polished. That is not the case for the present paper.,N
I showed this paper to my nurses and they agreed there was nothing new reported here.,N
The figure in the supplementary material is a mystery to me. Where did all this sound energy go? It defies the basic laws of physics.,C

"The introduction, general approach and data analyses are somewhat anachronistic–this study would have been really interesting 10-15 years ago, but now it seems quite out of date.",N
"The ideas behind the project seem to be a combination of wishful thinking, poor chemical insight and limited understanding of the techniques involved",N
"This is an outline of a paper, and not a fully-thought, well-organized, thoroughly-discussed paper. Maybe because it's a graduate student conference the author decided not to put any time into writing a quality paper that would be accepted in an academic journal.",N
I found every single reading of every theorist mentioned in this article seriously wanting. I will highlight the three most egregious because this review is already getting quite long.,C
this piece…shows no real understanding of history at all,C

I do not believe or trust the data presented or the underlying thesis.,C

This is an area ripe for future research.,C
This was a well-written study that upon my first reading appeared flawless.,N

"I appreciated how the author seemingly had in mind that a goodly percentage of

I retain in my files an anonymous referee's report on an earlier paper that relies heavily on this item. The report stops just short of urging revocation of my degree,N
"The manuscript is generally interesting, however, too narrow in its scope for us. Also, the paper is badly written, and poorly organized. In its current form, the paper cannot be accepted. The paper is poorly written or poorly thought-out. I think the paper is poorly written and most of its statements are wrongly and poorly motivated.",C

The arguments in the paper are compelling but not convincing.,N
"I thought that the author might be trying to ""have it both ways.â€ To be clear, this was just a passing thought and frankly, I read the manuscript about two weeks ago and don't remember the context, nor did I cross-walk one part of the essay with another to validate the thought.",N
... all I can say is that the author is blissfully unaware of what a standard is - in linguistic terms - and does not have the linguistic competence to describe it.,C
To improve this you need to be more robust on all fronts etc.,C

"I also added back in the two lines on p.16 that you'd inexplicably deleted. If there's a reason for their deletion, let me know.",C
This is a very weak paper trying to bend things to build a relationship that does not exist (...) Stating X is totally wrong and your data does not support that and no model can state this.,C
"Strictly speaking, the manuscript shall be rejected in its current form if submitted for a journal.",N
This is a confusing paper...,N
This was the moment when I stopped reading. Obviously the authors are not familiar with the research field.,N

"Maybe the clarity of stating the problem, purpose, method, finding, conclusion, and recommendation could be tweaked. Otherwise, congratulations on an outstanding contribution.",C
This literature review is nothing more than a merry dance around the books,N
"The text is overly expansive, desultory, and often diaphanous, so that the raison d'Ãªtre of an overarching theoretical structure is neither pellucid nor convincing.",C
The results look like a smorgasbord of data,C

"References are incomplete, listing only year and not volume, page numbers, etc. The lack of attention to this detail is a pet peeve.",N

I apologize for this but frankly some parts read like a report of aÂ high-school student on a scientific experiment.,N
"The entire paper reads a bit like someone who has searched around the social scientific research literature without much authentic understanding of social science, social scientific research methodology, Â or statistical analyses",N
"Which means that, as the saying goes, if their results are correct they cannot be new, and if they are ""newâ€ they cannot possibly be correct.Frankly, it is hard to say which is the case",N
The authors are perpetuating misguided generalizations in the face of substantial experimental data to the contrary,C

What is disturbing is that the author was not adequately supervised or otherwise assisted by faculty at her institution. They failed her completely in providing oversight and input.

"The introduction, general approach and data analyses are somewhat anachronistic-this study would have been really interesting 10-15 years ago, but now it seems quite out of date.",N
"There is a lot of terminology flung around here that is insufficiently explained. What exactly is meant, for example, by ""false negativeâ€ and ""false positiveâ€ rates? ""median, first quartile, and third quartileâ€?",C
"Since this is a model formulation paper, there does not need to be aÂ Results section, but if there were, the paper would be easier to follow. There really is no formulation of a model",C
"I appreciated how the author seemingly had in mind that a goodly percentage of the readership are not native speakers, so anything too academic or erudite might be lost on them.",N
"Unfortunately the manuscript is not well structured and the English is very poor. Usually I would attempt to improve this, but in this case the entire manuscript needs to be reworked - starting with the tittle.",C
"This is a misleading paper, badly executed and negligently written'",N

The description of sampling technique is too long and boring!,C
Nothing new or ground breaking is discussed in this tutorial,N
It is clear that this manuscript will not win a beauty contest. There are still many awkward sentences that make me feel like listening to someone that scratches a glass plate with an iron nail,N
The authors must know the difference between scientific research and 'news clip' for the Sunday newspaper.,N
This information is utterly useless and would not worth any publication at all.,N
Rev 1: The paper is generally well written (the English is good) Rev 2: A proof reading by a mother tongue would improve readability.,C
"These theoretical results have not been verified experimentally. Therefore, they are wrong",C
"When the author -and I'll refer to you as the author despite the effort you have put into ensuring that I know who you are - writes that there has been no new models in this area for 20 years, [lack of relevance] is the reason.",N
"This paper has about the same relevance as a paper in astronomy which places the earth as the centre of the university - while it can be made to look plausible, the basic premises is WRONG.",N
[H] did a few sloppy experiments and attached his name to the great pioneering work by [P]. He should not be mentioned.,N
"I still find this to be a very difficult paper to read, with many possible alternate explanations for [paper topic]. But it would take me a long time to try and figure this out, so I am approving publication.",C
"Considering by the end of the paper I had no idea what was being said, I don't believe the paper was successful in its argument. In fact, it felt like the author was merely saying the same thing over and over again but with synonyms.",N

"Concerning the discussion, again the merits of the work are downplayed to a point that it's almost pathetic!",N
"The accompanying simulation movie is neither interesting, nor particularly beautiful.",N
Presented paper has 13 pages and 26 adequate references. The paper seems to be very interesting.,N
I would suggest that you do some homework and redirect this work to an actual new and novel and mechanistic work and test it against real world data,C
proposal language is frightfully unclear.,C
I stopped reading here.,N
"I recommend the authors drop these assertions and predictions. The motivation for the present work, then, becomes an effort to characterise the effects. Unfortunately, this revised scope is more limited.",C
"I found the paper a challenge to evaluate, expecting some profound methodological or theoretical insight. Yet none appeared to be forthcoming.",C
"Your footnote is unnecessary, and indeed confusing. Where did you get the word ""oftentimesâ€ from? We are in the 21st century now.",C
It would be charitable to call this a comparison of apples and oranges. It's more like steak and bicycle.,N
I counted 15 uses of 'clear'Â or 'clearly.' That's one per page. 'Clearly' the results aren't as clear as the author would like them to be.,C
"So, in summary: the paper is oblique to the entire current literature, it fails to relate such investigations as it reports to the current literatures of the questions to which it claims to be relevant, and it actually acknowledges (in its own last sentence) that the history of the field has simply passed it by. It is as if the grant that it acknowledges for support was awarded in 1990 instead of, oh, 2010 or so.",C
They arbitrarily rule out models with interactions but without corresponding main effects. Etc.,C
"In the interest of being helpful, my suggestion is that the authors go back and review what is involved in the scientific method. An essential step in the scientific method is posing hypotheses and/or asking questions, and that step is completely lacking in this study.",C

Among the topics to be subject to the integrity of attention needs to be work related to the subject of innovation does not.,C
Reviewer #1: the conclusions are supported by the results and discussion. Reviewer #2: The main inconvenience of the paper is that the conclusions are not supported by the experimental results.,C
"The use of the word ""surgeriesâ€ to mean ""surgical proceduresâ€ instead of a surgeon's office is a linguistic atrocity of a magnitude similar to ""irregardlessâ€ or ""I could care less",C
The paper is ill-informed and poorly argued. It is not suitable in my view for this or any other journal.,N
This paper does not contain information that could make a scientific proposal.,N
We note that you may well have completed an interesting study with an appropriate research design and methods but the manuscript in its current form does not convey that.,C
I am sympathetic to what the author is trying to do here,N
It is not clear what the author wants to accomplish.,N
This whole paper is wildly speculative and needlessly convoluted.,N
revise this paper at your own risk,N
"It was hard to bite myself through, but in the back I found some meat.",N
The authors merely used somewhat bigger guns than previous studies and generatedÂ nothing but more smoke.,N
it is not clear whether important new insights will be gleaned - it cannot be clear until the final product of his research is reviewed.,N
Perhaps my greatest criticism of the paper is the tendancy of the authors to make an argument and then to almost immediately contradict themselves repeatedly.,N
"First, unless my statistics is failing me, a less than 1.0 SD is not significant.",C
"The text is at several places marred by conceptual messiness, careless reasoning, sloppyÂ phrasing and inadequate acquaintance with the relevant literature",C
"In addition, your figures are provided at 72 dpi, which is fine for children's games, but professional quality images require 300 dpi. Also, the images should be cropped to the actual image area (not embedded in a sea of white space).",C
SURELY THE AUTHORS CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER REFERENCE THAN WIKIPEDIA TO SUPPORT THEIR POINT HERE!,C
The authors do not control for the height of their subjects in their experiment. What they call prejudice against women may be argued to be prejudice against shorter people,C
"Using the question in the first paragraph of the introduction is not functional in my opinion, as are the words 'inner workings'.",C
This paper is fluently written and meticulously researched. I do not recommend it for publication.,N
The regression analysis is rubbish. Let's see what happens when you do this properly.,C
Neither research nor science,N
English need to be corrected by an english speaker,C
Reviewer 1: The questions in the reviewer comments have been addressed properly in the revised manuscript. I have no more comment before publication. Reviewer 2: I totally agree with the reviewer 1 that this paper is still difficult to read even after revision.,N
(although I admit that here is a possibility they might turn out to be correct in that they are guessing right),N
The whole piece presents a non-argument. It simply confirms something self-evident and dresses it up as remarkable by building up a straw man that is duly demolished.,N
"Poorly connected and thinly reported anecdotes are reported as though they represent detailed and searching ethnography, and then jargon-riddled assertions are made as though the meagre data substantiate the claims.",N
Are you kidding?,N
"I am concerned that the author is not getting the advice that she needs in order to produce a publishable paper, and I hope that my comments are read in the spirit in which they are intended; that is, constructive criticism to produce a better final product.",N
The results of the study are adequately justified.,C
"Overall, this paper goes to significant amounts of trouble to accomplish something that is already well established as a technique in a less elegant manner than is currently employed. This paper should not be published.",N
"It is difficult to see the merits of this proposal, and it is doubtful whether the author has the necessary command of primary and secondary sources to contribute anything to this area of research",N
"Unfortunately the paper itself is full of so many fundamental misunderstandings, I don't even know where to begin in criticizing it.",N
"However the paper has several fundamental flaws that give it little or no value as a thoughtful piece of research or reflection contributing new knowledge, perspectives or suggesting solutions to an important area of human endeavor.",N

The standard of writing (including spelling and grammar) is also satisfactory.,C
"I was only able to get a single reviewer and rather than make you wait longer, I decided to use the single review and my own independent reading. Unfortunately, my own reaction differed from the reviewer's reaction (scroll down below my signature). That is, the reviewer reacted positively whereas I reacted negatively and it is my reaction that counts.",N
Clearly you can tell that I have become distracted by the style of reporting results. I have in fact given up trying to find the real biological trends in the results.,N
"I invite the authors to provide compelling, coherent, and quantitative data.",C
I think the N-mixture modeling should be abandoned: it is clear that they [the authors] do not understand this class of models,C
"The abstract proposes the identification of requirements of a future digital infrastructure based on intelligent transportation systems (whatever this is). However, this aim is not fulfilled by the paper'",C
This inclusion criteria is not needed due to the fact to be in a master program they would be legal adults. Please remove and adjust anywhere that this shows up.,N
"This paper is so bad, it would take an entire 20 page paper to describe all the problems it has. And even after that I'm not sure it would be worth publishing.",N
"However, in my view the research question being asked is not very clear, the treatment of the dataset is not very thorough, and the conclusions are rather trivial or even self-contradictory.",C
Authors rarely followed the advices,N
"DO NOT have your heroes set the villain on FIRE. It's actually considered a war crime, and it is a very gruesome experience leaving horrific scars and affecting health for the rest of your life. It tends to make the heroes look like major arses.",N
"This sounds nice, but in fact it is vague. There are many instances of this kind of nice-sounding vagueness.",N
It is not even wrong,N
"The manuscript can be much kinder to those who are unfamiliar with, or not interested in, the issue.",N
"The opinion expressed in the MS is highly biased and patriotically motivated, and is not suitable for publication in this journal.",N
My argument against it as a full paper is that it makes an incremental contribution to the state of the science.,N
"Even though the objective of the paper pretends to be ambitious, there are a significant number of problems that limit the study's usefulness.",N
"Although this is a well written paper, it reminded me more of an essay that someone might write for a lit theory class rather than a generative scientific review.",N
"I am pretty sure that there are a number of mistakes, but I gave up pointing out them all because even the author apparently doesn't consider this manuscript as a good scientific presentation.",N
...this paper is extremely lengthy and tedious with respect to its importance and relevance.,C
"I hope you update soon, because I really wanna know what happens next, and how far you are willing to take the potential deconstruction.",N
"I believe that there are important questions in this area, questions that have intellectual merit, but the PI has not found any to study here",N
"This piece offers nothing new...is poorly written, analytically weak and repeatedly inaccurate.",N
"The paper brings to mind the Mark Twain quote: 'I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.'",N
"The paper is grossly over referenced, and reads a little like a student trying to impress a supervisor that a lot has been read, rather than a mature and parsimonious use of citations. The conclusions are hardly world shattering.",C
"[The manuscript's] tone is occasionally too casual, a bit too winking in a David-Foster-Wallace-ish kind of way. This is unfortunately borne out all too clearly in the author's self-presentation on his website, whose home page is inappropriate if not offensive as a professional introduction.",N
Based on these my recommendation would be that the present manuscript cannot be published in this or any other journal.,N
Startlingly naive and jejeune. Obviously a poorly tailored master's thesis.,N
A blizzard of extraneous data external information should be culled.,C
This last version is riddled with redundant information and circular phrases.,N
"""I am not inclined towards suggesting acceptance, simply because I have not enough elements to do so.â€Significance: 7/10 Soundness: 8/10 Theoretical and Empirical Analysis: 8/10 Presentation: 9/10",C
"The paper is blithely silent on the kinds of issues that occupy yards of library shelf-space, [and goes] well beyond what is warranted by the data.",N
"This paper is definitely not suitable to PNAS, or, for that matter to any other journal.",N
"Firstly, the framing of the research question is entirely flawed",C
"Not now, not ever.",N
I certainly agree [with your point] here but please do not justify it with all the selectivley chosen and largely incorrect arguments above,C
This is a rather pedestrian treatment of a popular and well-reported topic,N
Too mathematically inclined.,N
Despite my negative overall rating I encourage the authors to continue their research in this area but also suggest reading How to Design and Report Experiments by Field and Hole beforehand.,C
This is rubbish!!!,N
"Once I penetrated the pigeon English, I found very little substance underneath.",N
The author has re-invented lukewarm water. This is all naive philologising.,N
I am not very excited about this. There must be better ways to spend your money.,N
Some idea of strategies to define general populations for studies might be helpful both to the reader and to help the authors avoid their meaningless generalities.,C
I do not trust the data or the underlying thesis.,N
This paper still reads in places more like alternative fan-fiction than scholarship.,N
"There may be a good paper crying to be let out of this manuscript but if so, it is hard to know. The language, not to mention the overuse of symbols, is so dense that one quickly loses track of what was actually measured, what was invented or assumed, and what is being discussed.",C
"While it is true that the authors are under no ""legalâ€ obligation to cite these results, as they are unpublished, they are probably morally obliged to consider what they tell us in comparison with their own results.",C
It was agonizing for this reviewer to read a total of nine pages describing the overall methods.,N
Come on please!!!,N
"Why don't you just send copies of this to the two people in the world who care about it, and forget the publication route?",N
"This is a heretofore unobserved result and is very interesting, but is not novel.",N
"My comments indicate, primarily, a concern that you understand the nature of this case study design and the proper role of your case-specific theoretical argumentation, on the one hand, and the case-specific research data, on the other.",C
"As I understand it, you already have good evidence (you've said as much on Facebook). There's no reason to leave this as an open question when you know the answer.",C
"This is a nicely done paper but the sample is small, the measures uninformative, and the findings have only very weak relevance to policy or practice. Nothing much one can do about these flaws.",C
"I stopped reading the subsequent data reports carefully, because I no longer had confidence that they would be accurate.",C
The project is lack of interest.,N
Table 2 stunningly over-interprets some relatively small signals in the data.,C
"Reviewer 1: 'I really enjoyed reading the introduction'Editor in chief: 'In line with Reviewer 1's comments, the introduction does not a good job of citing the important historical litterature and putting this study in context'",C
"I think this article is carefully argued, but at no moment is it stated that Heidegger was a Nazi.",N
A classic instance of reinvention of the square wheel.,N
It is shocking to read how statistics are being misused just for the sake of being able to write something... I rate this article as very un-scientific...,N
The conclusion is something of a shaggy dog.,C
The derivation is correct but too simple! The paper is therefore not suitable for a general readership.,N
Not earth shatteringly original but it is hard to be so in this field.,N
"If philosophy of science was not taught in the author's doctoral program, (s)he needs to go back and dope slap his/her major professor.",N
"This paper represents an example of a piece of work that just crosses the threshold into the category of ""least publishable unitâ€.",N
The theoretical section is just about unreadable for anyone unfamiliar with the language of the relevant French theorists.,C
"[REDACTED]'s talks are popular, but then so are Ke$ha concerts.",N
The presentation is of a standard that I would reject from an undergraduate student,C
"Alarming errors, even if they could be easily corrected, gave the manuscript a sense of carelessness that makes me hesitant to recommend it for revisions.",N
This paper is so devoid of content it should be rejected outright.,N
"There is a sense that there is a finding, but not much of an explanation for why this finding makes sense, and why it is interesting and important. The introduction is particularly weak. It begins with some general statements which have nothing to do with the current research, and then describes each variable separately in an order that makes no apparent sense.",C
"There are a number of awkward sentences (these occur as early as the abstract), and the writer has a tendency to overburden the sentence. At a deeper level, the argument is at times uninspiring. Nevertheless, the topic is interesting enough.",C
The orgnization and writing of the paper need to improve. There are some grammar errors need to correct.,C
"The title of the submission is misleading and it should be renamed ""A Personal Diaryâ€...",N
The paper is neither exciting nor harmful.,N
Unless the authors performed some clever pagan ritual before euthanizing the animals I would use 'killed' (or 'euthanized') instead of 'sacrificed',N
Are we modelling an astronomical object here or an abstraction?,C
"Putting it unfairly perhaps, and I am sure this is not what is meant, but one ungenerous reading of the proposal is..'",N
This would have been a question of high interest 10 years back,N
"On my opinion, the approach the authors are using is trivial and the problem they are solving is made up.",N
The authors should at least try to read some of the previous work in the field before attempting to solve our problems.,N
The conclusions are still not consistent with the (lack of) findings.,C
"Theories can be meaningful when they can explain phenomenon. If theories exist for themselves, they may be play of language.",N
"A weak paper, poor experimental design, comparison of sequences using different primers, no statistical analysis possible, carelessly written, poorly thought through.",C
"The first and last paragraphs are weak and read in a style unlike the rest of the paper, like poor advertising copy.",C
I started to review this but could not get much past the abstract.,N
Very very sloppy,N
"The authors have entered a controversial area. For both their sake and the reputation of the journal, they need to make sure their research will stand up under the inevitable scrutiny.",N
"The author's spelling of coordinate, while technically correct, is arcane and annoying.",N
"The best thing about the paper in its current form is that is that it is [sic] short, so I did not waste a lot of time reading it; it looks like someone's smart graduate student has been foraging in theory and has managed to learn how to mangle simple concepts and hide them behind pretentious but empty prose.",N
"Good topic, but i dont get an idea of the results.",C
"Unless and until more appropriate methods are employed, it is impossible to judge the claims of the authors although, based on previous results, there is real reason to believe that the claims may pan out in some generic sense.",C
"I also would add that while I don't have anything serious to complain about, I also see this work as being pretty straightforward - there is no ""big ideaâ€ that I see as especially imaginative or creative. Again, it is extremely solid, just not necessarily sexy.",N
This is from a methods perspective rather unacceptable in these days of 'voodoo' science.,N
"If this topic were not dear to my heart, I would perhaps have struggled to follow your logic. I applaud the effort, and I find the data reviews relatively interesting and useful.",C
There are FAR too many analyses and results. The reader is swamped. It's simply not possible to take it all in. It needs to be pruned.,C
This technique will never work.,N
"This needs to be standardized!!! It must be converted into population density, e.g. inhabitants per km2!!!Why should we expect some kind of relationship with these variables?? It needs to be justified in the introduction!!!",C
"Mr. Beard is very courageous when he gives freely so many references to other books, because if a student ever did look at another book, I am sure he would not return again to continue reading Mr. Beard.",C
"Like Dr Who's Tardis, the inside of the paper is bigger than the outside.",N
"The odds ratios in Table 2 are like the plains of Kansas: flat, flat flat!",C
Perhaps I have just read these papers at monthly intervals and the author had bad luck.,N
The rest of this review operates from the assumption that this paper is a sincere attempt at scientific evidence and argument.,N
"I also do not feel that the lead PI is qualified to undertake this work, or more accurately, that she should undertake this work; she needs to be academically successful first.",N
"The research adds meaningful to the literature, how?",N
Was this an undergraduate class assignment?,N
Preliminary and intriguing results that should be published elsewhere.,N
"So, what is the point of this?",N
The statistical analyses were not correct. Actually they were so confused that I lost all confidence in the analyses and data presentation.,C
"This kind of prose simply borders on cruelty against the reader. And finally comes the conclusion, which is the intellectual equivalent of bubblegum.",N
I suppose that I should be happy that I don't have to spend a lot of time reviewing this dreadful paper,N
"My disappointment when finding flawed analyses, conclusions, and terminology [..] was therefore substantial.",C
"Other papers are cited that were clearly not read carefully, resulting in some memorable howlers.",N
This needs some rephrasingâ€”it's loaded with the assumption that there is a real world,C
The problem is epitomized by almost every word choice in the title,C
"Words are used inappropriatelyâ€”I count, for example, 13 instances of ""uniqueâ€, but it is used correctly only once.",C
"The authors showed the differences at scale 3, and so what?",N
Please use something in parenthesis so your reader doesn't have to take a break from reviewing your work to Google it,C
The introduction is so confusing and purely written that I gave up.,C
"And finally, the references are a mess.",C
"You will see that Reviewer 2 has slightly missed the point, so please don't pay too much attention to their comments in your revision.",N
I would suggest the authors to have some native English speaking to go through it,N
"This would be a stronger article if its tone were less polemical and more analytical. The following paragraph, for example, will strike many of your readers as shrill. They will stop reading the article and throw it into the fire",C
What do the authors mean by one standard error?,C
"This is such a promising topic, but I was very disappointed in this paper combining a substantial amount of author talent.",N
Please correct the language and connet of teh COI part!,C
"I am generally very happy to provide extensive suggestions and comments on manuscripts, but this submission was an absolute waste of my time.",N
"I understand that Wikipedia is not the best source for my information, however, I don't have access to the [peer-reviewed] literature you cite, and based on the information from Wikipedia, your hypothesis breaks down.",C
The authors offer no credible theoretical reason why we should care about this result.,C
"Not sure how to say this diplomatically, but the manuscript is really dull",N
All these data are given in the author's Ph.D thesis. Does this material need to be published?,N
"From this conclusion, the premise does not follow.",C
"The history of science tells us that a strong theory that explains numerous phenomena is generally overturned by a better theory, rather than by the wholly negative and nitpicking criticisms of the present paper.",N
"Who are and where did they come from? That is, why was this obsucre and arbitrary method chosen?",C
This review is without a doubt the single most difficult one I have had to write so far.,N
Reject - More holes than my grandad's string vest!,N
"That omission is a standard feature of articles from the fourth author's lab. Although it normally does not bite him, it does in this case.",C
"This paper is under-referenced, conceptually impoverished, and poorly written",C
This work amounts to a form of methodological perfectionism. Perfectionism can be the enemy of the possible in science.,N
The last two sentences of the summary greatly exaggerate the value of this paper and the usefulness of its conclusions.,C
"The research claims these phenomena are ""understudied,â€ as though there is some amount of study they should endure.",C
The most strikingâ€”and troublingâ€”feature of this manuscript is that it contains so many exceedingly strange assumptions.,C
"I'm disappointed to say, given the outstanding pedigree of the authors of this paper, that it adds nothing to earlier research.",N
"The abstract says absolutely nothing, and I mean this literally and not as a judgement for the content of the paper.",C
I am afraid this manuscript may contribute not so much towards the field's advancement as much as towards its eventual demise.,N
This ridiculous comment that a powerful computer algebra systems was required on page 6 is absurd.,C
I hope the authors can learn from this exercise on what is expected to craft a publishable paper.,N
"The paper is okay, its not ""wowâ€ but its hard to reject it.",N
They claim on page 9 a significant improvement of their method. This is stupid!,C
The figures are dishonest and not all that useful.,C
Studies undertaken in such a manner as presented here degrade all science by giving the semblance of legitimacy to illegitimate work.,N
"As far as this reviewer can tell, what the authors present is not so much a model as it is an equation.",C
"The present article, however, is in no way impressive, as its stands out by sloppiness in conceptual, theoretical as well as methodological aspects and does barely add any relevant knowledge.",C
The stimuli are impossible to compute.,C
"I know you want to use hormones to study physiological changes, but humans are more than hormones.",C
I was not sure exactly which problem the author is trying to solve and vice verse it was not clear to me what problem the solution is intended to solve or explorer.,N
To justify these conclusions and spur the authors onto the better things they are undoubtedly capable of I append some details.,N
This is a perfect example of the worst kind of research in social psychology.,N
I am constructing this review more in a stream of conscious thought than a systematic assessment.,N
That gives a ridiculous demonstration where authors forgot science and reinvent history (...) the authors don't have a clue of what was already done in the literature.,C
I have to reject this paper. It is saying a triviality hidden behind some math and I am not sure if the authors are even aware of this fact.,C
"In fact, your hypotheses are not all that complex are they? Nor is Figure 1; n'est-ce pas?",C
The underlying agenda is a sales pitch.,N
"I have received one highly negative review and wondered whether there are factors that would overcome or overturn this highly negative review, if XY received further reviews. I conclude that the answer is no.",N
Proposition 7 was so fundamentally wrong that I saw no point in reading beyond it.,C
"If the paper is accepted, I strongly recommend an English prof-reading.",C
"Did all 5 authors say,""Yes, this is a piece of work I am proud to have my name on?â€",N
"Unfortunatelly (sic), the paper is very shallow. The results are at the level of a naive master thesis.",N
I doubt that it's worth publishing a handful of graphs that few would find surprising and that anyone else could generate in a day off.,N
"This paper reads like a woman's diary, not like a scientific piece of work'",N
To put it bluntly: The last thing I want is a reviewer rejecting my papers with reference to an ideological paper like this one.,N
"While it unfortunately doesn't make for a flashy title (which the authors like more than British tabloids do), there is a simple alternative interpretation of their results.",C
The examples are stale - the method is not exciting. There is nothing much here.,N
This paper adds nothing to the existing knowledge of the subject.,N
"This, of course, is disingenuous if not unethical.",N
Experimental results are not convincing.,C
The paper didn't study what is the recall of the proposals and how sensitive the threshold is.,C
The proposed algorithm doesn't handle symmetry breaking when two edges are equally confident (in 4.2.2 it basically scales down both edges).,C
This is similar to a density map approach and the problem is that the model doesn't develop a notion of instance.,C
"However, I am a little worried that the proposed model may be hard to reproduce due to its complexity and therefore choose to give a 6.",C
"However, in the paper there is no motivation about why the architecture was designed like this.",C
"Experimentally, paper would benefit with better comparisons and studies: 1) state-of-the-art methods haven't been compared against (e.g. ImageNet experiment compares to 2 years old method).",C
Comparisons to using normal AdaBoost on more complex methods haven't been studied (other than the MNIST).,C
Comparison to simply ensembling with random initialisations.,C
"The proposed algorithm is essentially an ensemble algorithm, there exist several works on deep model ensemble (e.g., Boosted convolutional neural networks, and Snapshot Ensemble) should be compared against.",C
No empirical results on the effect of the parameter are given.,C
"Overall, the current evaluations focus on performance and give little insight into the behaviour of the method.",C
"The paper also does not compare to any other techniques that attempt to deal with catastrophic forgetting and/or the changing state distribution ([1,2]).",C
"Still, many of the design choices appear quite arbitrary and can most likely be improved upon.",C
There are no new things in such kind of reviews.,C
"In addition, the experiments section is not comprehensive enough as well the author only tested on two datasets.",C
"However, the paper lacks novel content.",C
It could be that this paper belongs to another venue that is more appropriate for survey papers.,C
"Only 1024 examples are considered, which is by no means large.",C
"Please see the major comment below.  One major comment: - Despite that the work is more application oriented, the paper would have been stronger and more impactful if it includes more work on the theoretical side.",C
This derivation should be treated more thoroughly and carefully.,C
"This discussion does not appear at all in the manuscript and it would be an important limitation of the method, specially when dealing with large-scale data sets.",C
"It is not completely clear to me that batch-normalization takes care of the scale constant (if so, then why did XNOR-NET needed an additional scale constant?),perhaps this should be further clarified.",C
"Section 1, the citation format of Bengio et al. (2013) should be (Bengio et al. 2013).",C
" Section 2, there is an ordering mistake in introducing Han et al.'s work, DeepComporession actually comes before the DSD. ",C
"Although the paper gives some justiification why auto-encoder can work for domain adaptation from perspective of probalistics model, it does not give new formulation or algorithm to handle domain adaptation.",C
The experiments are somewhat lacking.,C
One concern about this paper is that it doesn't fully answer the reasons why this normalization works better.,C
"And there is no demonstration of reconstruction quality relative to existing models, which could be helpful for evaluating relative performance.",C
But the contribution seems quite limited.,C
"If the presented approach was an improvement over the original conceptors, the evaluation should compare the new and the original version.",C
This is nice but doesn't really tell me much about overcoming catastrophic forgetting.,C
"First, the improvement of the proposed model over the previous state of the art is limited.",C
"In order to show the usefulness of the elimination module, the model should be exactly built on the GAR with an additional elimination module (i.e. after removing the elimination module, the performance should be similar to GAR but not something significantly worse with a 42.58% accuracy).",C
These words should be reserved to studies of Channel Capacity/Source Coding `a la Shannon.,C
Recent NN toolbox can easily compute the exact gradient and use it for the penalization but this is not clearly discussed even in appendix.,C
"On the negative side there is very limited innovation in the techniques proposed, that are indeed small variations of existing methods.  ",C
I still can not see how previous work by Balestriero and Baraniuk 2017 motivates and backups the proposed method.,C
"Notations in eqns (2) and (3) are not fully explained (e.g., boldface c).",C
I think the quality of the paper should be further improved by addressing these problems and currently it should be rejected.,C
"However, some implementation details are missing, which makes it difficult to assess the quality of the experimental results.",C
The positional attention is rather unclear and it would be better to revise it.,C
"This a simple example, but a lot of things in this paper is too briefly described and their impact not really evaluated. ",C
"On the negative side, the paper fails to make a strong case for significant impact of this work; the solution to this, of course, is not overselling benefits, but instead having more to say about the approach or finding how to produce much better experimental results than the comparative techniques.",C
"In my opinion, the authors should have put the focus on the DU4AC algorithm which get rids of this assumption.",C
"On the negative side, from what I can tell, the authors don't seem to have introduced any fundamentally new architectural choices in their neural network, so the contribution seems fairly specific to mastering StarCraft, but at the same time, the authors don't evaluate how much their defogger actually contributes to being able to win StarCraft games.",C
The evaluation is a bit limited to two specific downstream prediction tasks.,C
So the attack that the authors are proposing does not make sense and my take is that we should see significant changes before they can make sense.,C
"Hence, the contribution of this paper is limited, although the authors claim two differences between their work and the existing ones.",C
No new insight is being discussed.,C
Sec 6  Nothing too insightful is said about the RNN Model.,C
However comparisons are lacking and the paper is not presented very scientifically.,C
"However, the experimental evaluation is globally limited,  hyperparameter tuning on test which is not fair.",C
Cons -Experimental evaluation limited,C
The large scale aspect lacks of thorough analysis.,C
"The paper presents 2 contributions but at then end of the day, the development of each of them appears limited.",C
"However, the fact that no convergence rate is given makes the result weak.",C
"This can be coherent with the problem of Domain Adaptation that can be NP-hard even under the co-variate shift assumption (Ben-David&Urner, ALT2012).",C
This point is not very clear and we do not know how many source instances are used to compute the mapping - the mapping is incomplete on this point,C
"The performance comparison to the algorithm of Genevay et al. is somewhat limited: it is only on one particular problem, with three different hyperparameter settings.",C
"Typos --------  1. Section 2, paragraph 3 : is given in Figure 1 -> is given in Algorithm 1  ",C
But this benefit to the researchers does not seem to be strong enough for the acceptance at ICLR'18.,C
I would have been more enthusiastic if the authors had proposed a way to combine the training space exploration as well as removing redundant traces together to make the whole process more scalable and done experiments on reasonably sized data.,C
"The contribution from the RL perspective is limited, in the sense that the authors simply applied standard models to predict a bunch of labels (in this case, emotion labels).",C
"Concerning the related work, the authors didn't mention the Universal Value Function Approximation (Schaul et al, @ICML 2015) which precisely extends V and Q functions to generalize over goals.",C
"Since the paper does not provide significant theoretical or algorithmic contribution, at least more realistic and diverse experiments should be performed. ",C
"While this model is proposed as an extension of Kohonen's self-organising map (SOM), the paper fails to mention, or compare with, several historically important extension of SOM, which should perhaps at least include the generative topographic mapping (GTM, Bishop et al. 1998), an important probabilistic generalisation of SOM.",C
Quantitative analysis: I would suggest reporting confidence intervals;    perhaps just the 1st standard deviation over the accuracies for the true and    'adversarial' labels -- the min and max don't help too much in understanding,C
But it doesn't explore them yet in detail.,C
"Also, I believe the Z should be a vector, not a set. ",C
Weaknesses: - The paper is long (10 pages) but relatively lacks substances.,C
Minor: - Probably figure 4 can be drawn better.,C
The paper did not discuss these related work and did not compare the performances.,C
"Clarity: * Eqn. 5, LHS can be written more clearly as hat{a}_k.",C
In Table 2 the difference between inception scores for DCGAN and this approach seems significant to ignore.,C
"Because the tasks are not widely explored in the literature, it could be difficult to know how crucial exploiting graphically structured information is, so the authors performed several ablation studies to analyze  this out.",C
"For example, the model does not guarantee to be able to convert resulting indices to actual words (i.e., there are multiple words that have completely same indices, such as rows 4 and 6 in Table 5), and also there is no trivial method to restore the original indices from the composite vector.",C
The empirical evaluation is on the weak side and the rich properties of the model are not really shown off.,C
"This model is a relatively simple extension of the Neural Statistician, so the novelty of the idea is not enough to counterbalance the lack of quantitative evaluation.",C
I do not think the empirical results provide enough evidence that it is a useful/robust method.,C
"As a last minor comment, the authors should specify explicitly what the shaded areas are in Fig. 4b,c.",C
Minor comments - typos: a first application or this => a first application of this (p.2) - qualitative quality (p.2).,C
The lack of completeness (definitions of tasks and robustness) also makes the paper less impactful than it could be.,C
There are many small errors in syntax;  it would be best to have this paper carefully proofread.,C
"The exact relationship between the logical formulas and the stochastic trajectories of the MDP is not described in detail here, but relies on a robustness metric, rho.",C
"I see several issues: (i) It seems that you are not doing much with a SDE, as you diredctly jump to the discretized version (and ignore discussions of it's discretization).",C
"One important contribution of the paper is about optimal batch sizes, but related work in this direction is not discussed..",C
"One would expect more information to strictly improve performance,   but the results are a bit mixed (perhaps due to convergence to local optima and both actor and critic being learned at same time,    or the Gaussian assumptions, etc.).",C
"I think the main technical concerns with the paper is that the technique only applies to a linear model, and it doesn't sound the techniques are much beyond Kawaguchi'16.",C
"I think title is misleading, as the more concise results in this paper is about linear networks I recommend adding linear in the title i.e. changing the title to ... deep LINEAR networks",C
"The right part of the figure should be better described in the text or in the caption, I don't understand well what this illustrates.",C
There is no report of results on huge datasets like big Imagenet which takes a lot of time for deep training and we need automatic advance stopping algorithms to tune the hyper parameters of our model on it.,C
"It's better to explain this part in more details, possibly with some equations. It is hard to understand the difference.  ",C
But as a standard application of attention lacks novelty.,C
"Most of their experimentation is on microphone arrays with attention directly over magnitude-based input features, which cannot utilize the most important feature for signal separation using microphone arrays---signal phase.",C
"The winning system has a WER of only 5.8%(vs. 33.4% for the baseline system), while more than half of the submissions to the challenge were able to cut the WER of the baseline system in half or better! ",C
Significance:  It is hard to determine how significant the work is since the authors only compare with a single baseline and leave aside previous work on efficient exploration with Thompson sampling based on variational approximations.,C
"In this sense, I agree with the authors that the evaluation protocol for long-tailed datasets can't be just based on average accuracy, however, the protocol proposed requires to train the model several times, therefore, it does not scale properly to large datasets that are the common rule in the deep learning world.",C
The downsampling experiment in Section 5.1 seems to indicate the contrary: downsampling the memory should lead to position aliasing which seems to indicate that the agent is not using its memory to store the map and its own location.,C
"On the other hand, the proposed method is also specific to navigation tasks in 2D or 3D environment, which is hard to apply to more general memory-related tasks in non-spatial environments.",C
"But could be improved with some more details on the mathematical derivations (e.g., explaining where the constraints on alpha come from), and on the experiments (it is not entirely clear how the distributions of accuracies were obtained). ",C
"The authors should also avoid uninformative adjectives, clutter, and vague terms throughout the manuscript such as 'vital importance' or 'little room for fine-tuning'.",C
The presentation of the paper can be improved a bit.,C
"The authors chose to study only random instances which are known to be bad representatives of real-world problmes, instead of picking a standard benchmark problem. ",C
"Furthermore, the insights on how the network is actually solving the problems and how the proposed components contribute to the solution are minimal, if any.  ",C
"The proposed method seems to require a set of input/output examples even during evaluation (if my understanding is correct), which has limited practical applications.",C
"In terms of numerical stability, though experimental results were reported, there is no theoretical analysis.",C
The experiments are quite limited.,C
"For example, the phrase ""continuous input sequence"" does not make sense; maybe you mean ""input sequence of real valued quantities"".  ",C
"Since there are only two baselines are compared to the proposed method, this claim seems too general to be true.",C
"The authors fail to include the most standard baseline attack, namely FSGM.",C
"Actually, authors only consider synthetic (noise-free) data belonging to one class only, thus not including the factors of variations related to noise and/or different classes.",C
Language: the paper needs some careful editing to correct numerous language/grammar issues.,C
Major issues with the paper:  - Lack of reliable experiment section.,C
"Dataset is too small (2000 total samples), and model training is not described with enough details in terms of hyper-parameters tuned.  ",C
I found this statement to be a bit unclear and did not really describe what $g$ does; of course my understanding may be incorrect so a clarification on this statement would be helpful.,C
I feel that the text is often redundant and that it could be simplified a lot.,C
Thus I think this paper is below the acceptance threshold.,C
"However, where the paper falls a bit short is in the discussion / outlook in terms of suggestions of how one can go about tackling these shortcomings.  ",C
"as I explain below, I believe there is an underlying assumption that is not considered.",C
but could certainly do with more explanations.,C
"Some selections, which are presented in the papers are not explained, for example, the gradient penalty, the choice of lambda and the choice of points for gradient computation.",C
"The authors disclosed their identity and violated the terms of double blind reviews. Page 2 In our previous work (Aly & Dugan, 2017)  Also the page 1 is full of typos and hard to read.",C
"Again, due to lack of equations, I don't completely understand the last paragraph of 3.2, I suggest re-writing it (as well as some other parts) in a more explicit way.",C
The second part of the paper seems to be a bit disconnected to the quadratic function analysis.,C
"Our results below provide more evidence for making this transition. However, no other work on inference networks is directly cited.",C
"However, there is no comparison with other approaches in the literature.",C
"However, this is where I have issues with the work:  1) In all quantitative results, Chekhov GAN do not significantly beat unrolled GAN.",C
"I suggest the authors to either discuss why Chekhov GAN is obviously superior and hence no experiments are needed, or compare them experimentally.",C
"So it is not entirely convincing that the practical Algo 2 works better for the reason suggested by the theory, nor it drastically improves practical results that it could become the standard technique in the literature.",C
Since the main contributions are two algorithms for stable SGD it is not clear how one can formally say that they are stable. For this a formal problem statement is necessary.,C
"In particular one sentence that can be misleading: ""Given a classifier, one common way to generate an adversarial example is to perturb the input in direction of the gradient..."" You should explain that given a classifier with stochastic output, the optimal way to generate an adversarial example is to perturb the input proportionally to the gradient. ",C
The practical way in which the adversarial examples are generated is not known to the player.,C
Would be good to see the performance against other forms of adversarial attacks as well if they exist.,C
"Please find my detailed comments/questions/suggestions below:  1) IMO, the paper could have been written much better.",C
The overall significance of the results is not very strong since the paper focuses solely on experiments conducted on very limited data and artificially manipulated data.,C
The mode collapse issue is never discussed elsewhere in the paper.,C
Some typos     - page 4: some duplicate words in discriminative embedding session     - page 4: auxliary -> auxiliary     - page 7: tescting -> testing,C
"Without comparison to stronger baselines and with results only on 1 task constructed by the authors, we have to recommend rejection.",C
"The architecture does seem to work well on the associative retrieval task, but it is not clear yet if this will also be true for other types of tasks.",C
"However, no comparison is clearly made.",C
even if no methodological novelty has been introduced (this is also a cons!),C
"Though this is an important direction to investigate, there are several issues:  1. Comparison with previous results is misleading: a.t1-bit weights and floating point activations: Rastegari et al. got 56.8% accuracy on Alexnet, which is better than this paper 1.4bit result of 55.2%. b.tHubara et al. got 51% results on 1-bit weights and 2-bit activations included also quantization first and last layer, in contrast to this paper. ",C
The review of the literature is inaccurate.,C
"The description of the Heterogeneous Bitwidth Binarization algorithm is interesting and simple, and potentially can be practical, However it also adds more complication to real world implementations, and might not be an elegant enough approach for practical usages.",C
The method resembles quite a lot the Grad-CAM method and the conclusions from the experiment (shallow layers are robust enough to adversarial examples and middle layers ....) seem shallow as well.,C
"Overall, this reviewer leans towards rejecting this paper due to its limited contribution/novelty and the incomprehensive experiment results.",C
"Despite of its simplicity, there are no discussions/empirical comparisons with other approaches, and simple ablative analysis such as performance of detector with and without saliency maps.    ",C
" The mathematical notation needs a bit of improvement. E.g. argmin, sgn, min, etc. should be set in roman and parentheses should be enlarged to match the size of the enclosed expressions",C
The writing needs improvement and the paper in general needs some copy editing.,C
But unfortunately doesn't show any results even qualitative like generated samples for other  work on next frame video prediction.,C
"However, I don't think the authors explore the idea well enough -- they simply appear to propose a non-parametric way of learning the stochastic model (sampling from the training data z_i's) and do not compare to reasonable alternative approaches. ",C
"The datasets are too small with observations in low dimensions, and I found it not very fair to consider LSTM in such settings.",C
I am a bit surprised that you have not discussed it in the paper not to mention provided a baseline to compare your method to.,C
No training details are provided.,C
"It is really interesting, so improving the quality of this figure will really help.",C
Main weakness of the paper:  - Missing many IC systems citations and comparisons (see https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/3221#results),C
The experimental results are not well explained and there is not enough analysis of the results.,C
"however the presentation of tables and figures could be done better, for example, Fig. 2 is referred  to in page 3,  Table 2 which contains results is referred to on page 5, Fig 4 is referred to in page 6 and appears in page 5, etc.",C
The authors are advised to do a thorough survey of the relevant works in Multimedia and computer vision community.,C
The experiments are also not enough.,C
"Overall, I would like to vote for a weakly acceptance regarding this paper.",C
It would be better to present accuracy as for the other tables/experiments,C
The performance is not strong enough to warrant acceptance by itself.,C
" The authors should provide the experimental results on large-scale data sets (e.g. ImageNet) to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, as they only conduct experiments on small data sets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.",C
There is only one definition of the reward - related to batch number when the accuracy first exceeds a threshold.,C
None of these works have been compared with.    b. All the baseline methods use 8 bits per value.,C
"There is an explanation indicating that switching from SGD to TR causes an uphill movement (which I presume, is due to the trust region radius r being large); but statements such as - this will lead to climbing over to a wide minimum etc. are too strong; no evidence is given for this.",C
But there is no good and detailed experimental analysis that help explain these observations.,C
The writing of the paper needs a lot of improvement.,C
"The paper contains several grammatical mistakes, and in my opinion could explain things more clearly, particularly when arguing that the algorithm 2 will converge.",C
"For example, there is a lot of math, but in Section 4.5 the authors seem to hedge and say We give an intuitive explanation ... and leave the rigorous analysis to future works.  Please clarify.  ",C
"The choice of activations is not motivated, and performance on variants is not reported.",C
"The use for a genetic algorithm for optimization is not motivated, and no comparison is made to the performance and efficiency of other approaches (like standard backpropagation)",C
"However, the paper lacks discussion / evidence of how hard it is to optimize for this VGG-based PIR score.",C
"Overall, I find this direction exciting and hope the authors would keep pushing in this direction! However, the current manuscript is not ready for publication.",C
The statement lacks scientific support.,C
More comments: The main problem with this paper is that the proposed systems is designed for a human interaction setting but no such experiment is done or presented.,C
"Incomplete experiments: The authors only show experiments on videos containing objects that have already been seen, but no experiments with objects never seen before.",C
"The authors also don't show any results on previous datasets, which would allow for a more objective comparison to existing state of the art.",C
n - I found the idea of Figure 1 very good but in its current form I didn't find it particularly insightful (these clouds are hard to interpret).,C
"I suggest the authors to demonstrate their method on some well-known datasets (e.g., MovieLens, Netflix), to give the readers an idea if the proposed method is indeed advantageous over more classical methods,",C
"However, no results are provided for deeper networks, so it is unclear how this method can benefit the computation of very deep neural networks ",C
"Unfortunately, I do not believe the paper is ready for publication as it stands, as it suffers from lack of clarity and the experimentation is limited in scope.",C
It would be more helpful if the author can make those points more clear and offer some guidance about the choices between explicit and implicit transform in practice.,C
"My main issues with this paper are experiments: The proposed approach is tested only on 2 datasets (one synthetic, one real but tiny - 2K instances) and some of the plots (like Figure 5) are not convincing to me.",C
"I can see how it adds value over sampling  from the prior, but it's unclear if it has value over a modern approximate inference  scheme like a black box variational inference algorithm or stochastic gradient MCMC.",C
Cons: Some statements in this paper are not clear to me.,C
"This statement, in my view, could be misleading without further explanation (the non-sparse loss was mentioned in the abstract).",C
"Although the proof of the algorithm relies on the online learning regret bound, the algorithm itself requires visit all the data in each update, and thus, it is not suitable for online learning.",C
"The algorithm is closely related to boosting and MKL, while there is no such comparison.",C
Some minor points that I wonder about:  - The heuristic against repeating trigrams seems quite crude.,C
so that the recurrent neural networks with attention could capture the learning signal to avoid the repetition issue and the heuristic function in the test time can be removed.,C
The paper is readable but not well polished,C
There is no quantitative evaluation and comparisons.,C
I think such generalization is interesting but the innovation seems to be very limited.,C
And those theorems in section 4 are just some properties from previous definitions; they are not theorems.,C
The results could make more sense by providing total time consumptions and time cost per iteration.,C
Section 5.3 could be improved by providing a curve (compression vs. error) instead of just providing a table of sampled operating points.,C
"For example, it is claimed that the proposed decomposition provides enhanced representation ability, but this is not justified rigorously either via more comprehensive experimentation or via a theoretical justification.",C
"Source of confusion: in algorithm 1 and 2, tilde{z} is sampled from Q_TH(Z|xi), some one is lead to believe that this is the sampling process as in VAEs, while in reality Q_TH(Z|xi) is deterministic in the experiments.",C
"But given the high price of quantum annealers, limited applicability of the technique, and unclear benefits of the authors' method, I do not think it is relevant to this specific conference.",C
"Further, the paper seems to simply leave out some portions: the introduction claims that one of the contributions is we show that techniques such as latent space trajectory embedding and dynamic unfolding can significantly boost the performance of the model based control variates, but I see literally no section that hints at anything like this (no mention of dynamic unfolding or latent space trajectory embedding ever occurs later in the paper).",C
"But because (unlike traditional baselines) introducing it alone would affect the actual estimate, they actually just add and subtract this term, and separate out the two terms in the policy gradient: the new policy gradient like term will be much smaller, and the other term can be computed with less variance using model-based methods and the reparameterization trick.",C
"But I also feel that in this case, it borders on being an issue with the paper itself, as I think this idea needs to be described much more clearly if it is central to the underlying paper.",C
"Also, the paper needs to be re-organized in a better way (eg., state clearly the difference from previous methods, how to formulate the story, etc.) For now, I don't think it is ready to ICLR. ",C
"However, it is a bit weird that 1) 100% tuned results are not shown, and 2) the learned activation goes up as the input goes negative, which is not the shape of ELU.",C
"Also,  no details are given on how the mixing in the rollouts was tuned.",C
"It is a combination of two techniques, dense connections and multiple attention and it is not clear where the actual gain come from.",C
"Finally, the writing of the paper could be improved a lot: The basic idea is not well described (however, many times repeated) and the grammar is often wrong and also there are some typos.",C
"Cons:  - related work, in particular the first paragraph, should compare and contrast with the closest extant work rather than merely list them",C
"However, the novelty of the paper is limited and the experiments are not sufficient.",C
"However, there is no experimental comparison with these methods.",C
"although it is clearly not sufficient to explain even the success on the setting studied in this paper, since the number of minima of a certain type does not correspond to the probability of the SGD ending in one: to estimate the latter, the size of each basin of attraction should be taken into account.",C
"Basically the motivation and method is good, the drawback of this paper is its narrow scope and lack of necessary explanations.",C
Minor: - t of $G_t$ in page 2 is not defined so far. - What is gr in Section 2.2,C
You should clearly divide the existing study and your work.,C
KSS seems to need the user study.,C
"But I do not catch the details of the user study, e.g., the number of users.",C
"However, I am not convinced that this is novel enough for publication at ICLR.",C
"In other words, the authors oversell their own work, specially in comparison with the state of the art.",C
"Besides this deficit, the paper does not present a proper statistical setup (e.g. 'Is censoring assumed to be at random? ...) , and numerical results are only referring to some standard implementations, thereby again neglecting the state-of-the-art solution. ",C
There are some concerns about this network that need to be clarified: 1. sigma is never clarified in the main context or experiments 2.,C
"In the experimental results, detailed definition or explanation of the compared methods and different settings should be clarified.",C
Cons:  -The grammar in the paper is pretty bad.,C
The technical contribution of this paper is small.,C
Experimental results are available only on a small dataset and for two different networks.,C
"In experiments, no comparisons against existing works is performed (at least on toy/controlled environments).",C
or even how reliable they are since the effectiveness has not been evaluated.,C
"Minor comments:  In introduction, parameter with zero training error doesn't mean it's a global minimizer In section 2, it is not clear that visualizing loss function is helpful in see the reasons of generalization given minima.",C
"In figure 2, why do we have solutions at 0 for small batch size and 1 for large batch size case?",C
Typoes:  Legend of Figure 2: red lines are error -> red lines are accuracy Table 1: test accuracy -> test error Before 6.2: architecture effects -> architecture affects,C
The authors point to recent GAN literature that provides some first results with high resolution GANs but I do not see quantitative evidence in the high resolution setting for this paper.,C
I am not able to accept this paper because of the latter point.,C
"Especially given that w=2 works best for speech recognition, it not clear that the model extension is actually helping.",C
"For document summarization the paper presents a strong result for an online model, but the fact that it is still less accurate than the soft attention baseline makes it hard to see the real significance of this.",C
This comment variational typically underestimate the uncertainty in the posterior...whereas expectation propagation methods are mode averaging and so tend to overestimate uncertainty... is not precise.,C
Bayesian recurrent neural networks already exist and is rather vague for what is being described in this paper.,C
"Cons -  * The main narrative is lost in the text, leaving a reader unsure of the authors main points and contributions as they read.",C
"In particular, the paper would benefit greatly from being made much shorter, and having more of the important details or proof outlines for the various propositions in the main text.",C
"So, while I cannot vouch for the correctness, I think it can and should go through a serious revision to make it succinct and that will likely considerably help in making it accessible to a wider readership and aligned to the expectations from a conference paper in the field. ",C
"I expected that some observations about this point will be unveiled in the paper, but unfortunately, the paper described only a few BLEU scores with different window sizes which have not enough information about it.",C
"2/ the datasets are small ones, as well as the vocabularies, you should try with larger datasets and bpe for sake of comparison. ",C
The authors may want to consider citing,C
"it missed several recent works in this area: - Steerable CNNs, Cohen & Welling - Dynamic Steerable Blocks in Deep Residual Networks, Jacobsen et al.",C
" Learning Steerable Filters for Rotation Equivariant CNNs, Weiler et al.",C
"The evaluation, however, is quite limited.",C
" Low performance on Charades dataset, no comparison to prior work.",C
"However, where possible experiments should compare directly with prior published results on these tasks; none of the experiments from the main paper or supplementary material report any numbers from any other published work.",C
There is no mention of computational cost.,C
Experiments (in main paper) only show speedups and do not show loss of accuracy due to sparsity,C
The baseline experiments are a bit limited - it's clear that such baselines would never produce samples which are any better than the fixed version which is fed into them.,C
The paper should be checked for typos.,C
I expected the numerical experiments to show results instructive about what representations or what abstractions are learned in the different layers of the network using the learning algorithm and objectives suggested.,C
There aren't any new technical ideas here.,C
"Third, the authors do not compare against some relevant, recent work, e.g., Springenberg et al. (http://aad.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/16-NIPS-BOHamiANN.pdf) and Snoek et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05700.pdf) that is essential for this kind of empirical study.     ",C
"That is not to say that an empirical exploration of the practical implications is not of value, but that the paper would be much stronger if it was better positioned in the literature that exists.",C
but we are still missing a detailed analysis for most of the assumptions and improvements claimed in the paper.,C
But a lot of details is missing and needs clarification.,C
A lot of technical details are missing.,C
The experiments do not however demonstrate why the algorithm is performing better.,C
"There is a lot of previous work on evaluating similarity in word embeddings (e.g. Hill et al, a lot of the papers in RepEval workshops, etc.); specialization for similarity of word embeddings (e.g. Kiela et al., Mrksic et al., and many others); multi-sense embeddings (e.g. from Navigli's group); and the hubness problem (e.g. Dinu et al.). For the localized centering approach, Hara et al.'s introduced that method. ",C
"The evaluation is limited, in that the standard evaluations (e.g. SimLex would be a good one to add, as well as many others, please refer to the literature) are not used and there is no comparison to previous work.",C
"The results are also presented in a confusing way, with the current state of the art results separate from the main results of the paper.",C
Minor points: - Typo in Eq 10 - Typo on page 6 (/cite instead of cite),C
"In addition to the incoherent presentation, the proposed method lacks proper justification.",C
Results on tiny datasets.,C
"This point is murkier, because the paper doesn't discuss possible increases in *training time* (due to increased number of iterations) in much detail.",C
"It would have been better to omit it and use the space to describe HDDA and the specific variant used in this work, as this is the main tool doing the distinction.",C
"The details are as follows.  1.  Limited novelty and performance comparison - the idea of unsupervised manifold projection method has been proposed and well-studied in MagNet: a Two-Pronged Defense against Adversarial Examples, appeared in May 2017.",C
"In summary, this paper has limited novelty, incremental contributions, and lacks convincing experimental results due to weak attack implementation.       ",C
"Information about the detailed setup is also lacking, specifically which test and development sets are used (the WSJ corpus has several sets).",C
Structure could be improved.,C
"While the bidirectional loss is a proper loss and optimized as such (by optimizing both E^adv and E), the pivot objective is no loss function, as it does not correspond to any function any optimization algorithm could minimize.",C
"The other mentions provide signal, but does not provide conclusive evidence.",C
"IMHO, most problems in these domains get away with a few hundred time steps; nevertheless, I'd appreciate a few examples where this is a case to better justify the method.",C
the theory is mostly recycled and the empirical results in Section 4 are known; thus it is below acceptance threshold due to lack of novelty.,C
"The abstract and the conclusion should be revised, they are very vague.",C
The abstract should be self contained and should not contain citations.,C
"Instead of the  umerical result show the performance of the new model, give some numerical results here, otherwise, this sentence is useless.",C
"As Eq 2 -> As the minimization of Eq 2 (same with eq 4) - Don't start sentences with And, or But  ",C
"Generally, a clear introduction of the problem is also missing.",C
The size of the set of nodes might be meant.,C
"On a more technical level the properties of the learned Mahalanobis matrix, i.e. the fact that it should be PSD, are not really discussed neither how this can be enforced especially in the case where S is a full matrix (even though the authors state that this method was not further explored).",C
Many details of the paper are missing and should be included to clarify the approach and ensure reproducible results.,C
"Evaluation: Currently, only neural abstractive methods are compared.",C
But I think the paper would be a lot stronger and more convincing with some additional work.,C
WEAKNESSES: While the strengths mentioned above are obvious I had the impression through the whole paper that a whole part is missing.,C
"Taking into account this major weaknesses I cannot accept this paper and I do not think it is worth discussing results and applications in Sections 3,4,5 before authors detail, explain and clarify how exactly they have obtained these results. ",C
"A very small dataset (3,300 subjects and 3,353 images) is used in the whole investigation.",C
It is doubtful that the conclusion or results obtained in this small dataset could be scaled up to real-world applications or datasets (millions of subjects and images).,C
"but it is not clear what the strengths are, and the presentations needs to be done more carefully.",C
No new theory development.,C
"But most importantly, none of these results are measured in a quantitative way: they are all qualitative, and thus subjective.",C
This is a crucial parameters that is however not discussed nor analysed in the paper.,C
They compare the proposed SN with other traditional approaches on a very small data  set with 670 samples and 138 features.,C
Typos: Several citations are unparenthesized when they should be.,C
Cons -It is not clear why GANs are the only generative model considered,C
"As far as I can see, the variable g_i^LRP wasn't defined, and the use of Eq. 5 to achieve this last could be better explained.",C
"Third, the paper is not well presented and organized: the introduction is scant; the notational formulism is not at all clear, rigorous, or consistent; the paper overall lacks polish, with many grammatical errors.",C
"Overall, I feel that while this line of research is worthwhile, at this stage the work is not yet ready for publication.",C
"The authors experimented one trained CNN and tested on images on only three categories (Persian Cat, Container Ship, and Volcao).",C
"The analysis of manifold structure of DNN is important direction, but I am afraid novelty and insight of this work is not enough for acceptance.",C
"but this should be empirically motivated(e.g. figures) in the subsection 2.1, and this is not done.",C
"Besides a good observation that LSH fits well into SDG, there are no more in-depth results provided.",C
"While the proposed regularization does lead to a nicer Euclidean geometry, there is not sufficient motivation and evidence showing this regularization improves classification accuracy.",C
" Equation 1 contains the norm operator twice, and the first norm has no subscript, while the second one has an l_2 subscript.",C
Pro: - Paper addresses an important problem: qualitative / quantitative understanding of the behavior of adversarial perturbations is still lacking.,C
"Overall: - As is, it seems to me the paper lacks a significant central message (due to limited and unfocused experiments) or significant new theoretical insight into the effect of AT.",C
More datasets should be tested for evaluation.,C
The manuscript is written in a very compact style and I wish some passages would have been explained in more depth and detail.,C
"If the point is that the options can add useful information to induce better representations for passage/question, there should be some simple baselines in the middle that this paper should compare to. ",C
"For instance, the use fertility supervision during training could be better motivated and explained.",C
"Detailed comments: * Authors should at very least cite (Vinyals et al, 2017) and explain why the environment and the dataset released for Starcraft 2 is less suited than the one provided by Lin et al.",C
"For applications with security concerns, there should have been methods to guard against man-in-the-middle attack, and the paper should have at least considered some of them.",C
"As ESIM is one of the key components in the experiments, you should briefly introduce ESIM and explain how you incorporated with your vector representations into ESIM.",C
"I realize that this is likely due to computational or time constraints, but it is worth providing some explanation in the text for why the experiments were conducted in this manner.",C
"Those approaches should at least be discussed in the related work, if not compared against.",C
"Moreover, the context selection variable a should be considered part of the dataset, and as such the paper should report how a was selected.",C
"Still, the paper as it stands is not complete, and I encourage the authors to followup with more thorough quantitative empirical evaluations. ",C
"It would be nicer if they include results for all S_{attack} values that they have used in their experiments, which would also give the reader insights on how the anomaly detection performance degrades when the S_attack value change.",C
"In addition, for such experiments, a clear report of parameters and FLOPs for each network should be included in the results table.",C
Section 2: better to explain about how to obtain attention scores z in more details.,C
The paper dives into the literature of counter-factual regret minimization without providing much intuition on why this type of ideas should provide improvement in the case of partial observable domain.,C
Having proper mathematical description and good diagrams of what you doing would have immensely helped.,C
Given that I see only one example I can not objectively know if your model produces examples like that 'each' time so having just one example is as good as having none.,C
"Missing discussion to the attention is all you need paper, which seems highly relevant",C
"And finally, perhaps complementary to point 2), you really need to provide examples on more than one environment.",C
"   Highway networks were published half a year earlier than resnets, and reached many hundreds of layers before resnets. Please correct.",C
You should show the error curve until convergence is reached.,C
There has been some confusion in the literature as to which of these parameterizations is better or more standard; simply justifying the choice of parameterization a little more would also help.,C
The structure of Section 3 needs to be improved.,C
"Instead of listing each step in each subsection, a general introduction picture should be introduced first. More intuition is also needed for each step.",C
"Hence, lambda in Eq. 3 may need to be chosen differently depending on the adversarial model. Without tuning lambda for each method, the empirical experiments seem unfair.",C
"Even though the proposed method works better, the prediction accuracies of S are still high.",C
Some incomplete technical details and non-standard benchmarks makes this not completely ready for publication.,C
These appear to be dataset specific and finding the optimal configuration here requires significant experimentation that takes significantly more time than just running the baseline.,C
"The paper is very well-written and makes for a rather pleasant read, save for some need for down-toning the claims to novelty as voiced in the comment re: Ravi & Knight (2011) or simply in general:",C
" There are some gaps in the awareness of the related work in the sub-field of bilingual lexicon induction, e.g. the work by Vulic & Moens (2016).",C
The application of the search algorithm in case of imbalanced classes could be something that require further investigation.,C
"The loss functions in Eq. (3) should be made more precise. It remains unclear whether the profile coefficients and the weights are trained jointly, separately, incrementally etc.",C
The presentation can be improved.,C
" The main originality of paper is the block style. However, the paper doesn't analyze how and why the block brings improvement.",C
"On the theoretical side, the discussion could be improved. Namely, Section 3 about limitation of domain adversarial training correctly explained that domain adversarial training may not be sufficient for domain adaptation if the feature extraction function has high-capacity. ",C
"It would be interesting to explain whether this observation is consistent with Theorem 1 of the paper (due to Ben-David et al., 2010), on which several domain adversarial approaches are based. ",C
Cons: - Some choices leading to the optimization problem are not sufficiently explained. - The theoretical discussion could be improved.,C
The presentation could be improved.,C
I would be interested to know more about the intuition behind the proposed method.,C
"Despite the the idea of exploiting generative models to perform data augmentation is interesting, using it as an evaluation metric does not constitute an innovative enough contribution.",C
3. The authors should clarify if the method is specifically designed for GANs and VAEs,C
In order to evaluate a generative model one should test on the generated data only (tau=1) I believe.,C
Only a simple example will make this paper more convincing.,C
But I have the following complaints:  (1)  I have the same question as the other reviewer.,C
"I feel if comparing L=2 vs L=3 is hard, the authors should be more up front about that in the introduction/abstract",C
I think it would have been stronger if the authors would have provided some empirical results validating their claims.,C
The paper will be much stronger if it has some experiments along this line.,C
"This reviewer has found the proposed approach quite compelling, but the empirical validation requires significant improvements:",C
"Hence, the title seems a bit misleading.",C
It is interesting to add the memory cost per channel into the optimization process.,C
It would be intersting to present some analysis regarding the gradient w.r.t. W.,C
"I think it is crucial to highlight that the deficiencies of DIB matter in practice, and are not simply a theoretical consideration.",C
At least one experiment should be carried out on a larger dataset such as ImageNet to further demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.,C
Adding an overview figure of the architecture in the main paper (instead of supplementary) would be helpful.,C
It is indeed a good method for dealing with the variance.,C
The distribution  could be replaced with a normalizing flow.,C
An actual experiment using full dataset or minibatch gradients on CIFAR and the same k value would be more interesting.,C
" In Eq. (6), although due to the convex-concave either min-max or max-min are equivalent, such claim should be explained explicitly.",C
"Meanwhile, Since the proposed algorithm requires extra optimization w.r.t. random feature, it is more convincing to include the empirical runtime comparison.",C
"These papers don't diminish the submission, but they should be clearly acknowledged and the contribution of the submission relative to these prior works should be discussed.",C
"Also, please either provide more qualitative examples or provide some type of quantitative evaluations (through user study , dataset statistics, or down-stream recognition tasks)",C
" Overall, I believe the paper is interesting but not ready for publication.",C
"For example, the paper will be more interesting if inception scores were shown for various challenging datasets.",C
There is some empirical testing which show the presented method in a good light.,C
I think this issue should have been examined in more depth.,C
"Cons: - Clearly, the proposed function is not faster than ReLU.",C
" Conclusion: - Based on the comments above, I recommend weak reject.",C
And uses them to show that an exponentially large number of non-overlapping ConvACs are required to approximate the grid tensor of an overlapping ConvACs.,C
The authors should compare to such methods as a baseline.,C
"Moreover, the running of computing the node embedding must be emphasized: On page 2 the authors claim a constant time complexity at the instance level",C
"Therefore, it should not be accepted in its current form.",C
"Also, it would have been good to see more experiments with smaller baseline networks as well to match the smaller DenseNet networks in Table 1 and 2.",C
Evaluation is limited; granted this is the nature of the target domain.,C
"This makes it very hard to reproduce the experimental results (in order to verify it), and its practical value becomes quite restrictive (very few organizations can afford such a cost).",C
"I would encourage the authors to implement colocRL [1] on their own hardware and software systems, and make direct comparison. ",C
"The paper's title also does not seem to fit: this feels like a survey paper, which is not reflected in the title",C
I would like to see more discussions on the relation to these methods and more strong arguments for convincing reviewers to accept this paper.,C
I would suggest just including the visualizations of the optimization trajectories which are done correctly and focus on deriving interesting/useful conclusions from them.,C
" Based on mixture assumption, I suggest the author add one more comparison to other method,",C
It is also unclear how tricks in the paragraph above section 2.4 affect training and decoding,C
"Since the authors are extending their work and since these issues might cause training difficulties,",C
it might be useful to look into these design choices,C
"In my opinion, the quality of the paper would be much improved by a brief discussion of this, and some reflection on what aspects of these variation contribute to the confidence vectors and what isn't captured.",C
"As such, I do not recommend it for acceptance - it needs significant work before it can be accepted at a conference.",C
The paper should at least outline the strategy.,C
"5. In the synthetic data experiments on comparison with single-task and multi-task models, counter-intuitive results (with larger training data split, ANMSE raises instead of decreases) of multi-task models may need further explanation.",C
All figures (but in particular Figure 3) need more informative captions,C
Maybe more justifications are needed.,C
"To make the paper better, more empirical results are needed.",C
"However, I strongly encourage the authors to perform additional experiments with careful experiment design to address some common concerns in the reviews/comments for the acceptance of this paper.",C
", but the abstract and introduction make very strong claims about outperforming state-of-the-art supervised approaches",C
We believe the method and paper could potentially be improved and make a good fit for a future bioinformatics focused meeting such as ISMB/RECOMB.,C
And if the authors are able to address it satisfactorily I will increase my score.,C
"Overall, I think it is a borderline paper.",C
"Comment: I believe if I understood the above correctly, it would be easier to explain tensors/matricization first and then introduce separation rank,",C
since I think it much makes it clearer to explain,C
. The main concern with the paper is that I am not sure whether the RAC studied by the paper is realistic enough for practice.,C
"If the baselines are stronger and this point is more convincing, I am happy to raise my rating of the paper.  [1] ",C
*************** Updates:  *************** The authors have clarified some questions that I had and further demonstrated the benefits of copula transform with new experiments in the revised paper.,C
The new results are quite informative and addressed some of the concerns raised by me and other reviewers.,C
"Without a proper motivation, its difficult to appreciate the methods devised.",C
Targets an important problem  Cons: - Related work seems inadequately referenced,C
The topic is an important one and a very difficult one.,C
"The paper is presented as a rather undigestible and tortuous
collection of disparate results.",N
"My greatest criticism of the paper is the tendency of the
authors to make an argument and then to almost immediately contradict
themselves repeatedly.",N
The writer of the paper is utterly ridiculous and contradicts his assumptions after every paragraph.,N
I felt like I was reading a horror movie…,N
"I cannot possibly imagine what could have led the authors to
believe that their paper was remotely interesting enough to submit for
publication.",N
I have rarely read a more blown-up and annoying paper.,N
"An exercise in feature manipulation, of the brainless kind.",N
"Author having expertise in poor language, weird sentences, half true statements and even
nonsense statements, has succesfully drafted a ""masterpiece"" of crap.",N
"This is a disaster. I could continue, but you see my point.",N
"Maybe the authors should cite a reference intended for pile of shit. The paper has no structure, no merit. Just a heretic conclusion.",N
Perhaps my greatest criticism to the paper is that the authors stop writing.,N
"I am personally offended that the authors believed that this study
had a reasonable chance of being accepted to a serious scientific journal.",N
The authors do not control for the height of their subjects in their experiment. What they call prejudice against women may be argued to be prejudice against shorter people.,N
This is a rather pedestrian treatment of a popular and well-reported topic.,N
That’s not how science is done.,N
it is doubtful whether the author has the necessary command of primary and secondary sources to contribute anything to this area of research.,N
English as a second language?.,N
Early career?,N
Not a member of the reviewer's preferred gender?.,N
"If the authors are so keen on ‘solving a problem’ of little practical significance to the field, maybe they should apply their skills to solving sudoku.",N
"Several sources are cited, but there is little evidence to suggest that the authors themsleves have been consulted. A bunch of nerds with unintelligible paper.",N
The only conceivable contribution this paper can make is by providing the academic community with an alternative to counting sheep.,N
I would suggest either activating the spell-checker on Word or finding a way to keep your cat from walking on the keyboard.,N
"If the author is comfortable with having his/her name on THIS, then I won’t stand in the way of publication.",N
"The author has done a substaintial amount of work, but it isn't clear why they have done so much work. The entire paper appears as pointless prolix .",N
The researchers trying too hard and achieving too little.,N
It is a paper one can very well get along without reading.,N
A disappointment … not the work of a wise and mature researcher.,N
Not one proposition omade by the author will be used by any literate person in the world.,N
It seems to me to present someone's work at his worst.,N
Did not discuss a related paper.,N
The author did not understand some parts of the submission and is unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. How they easily they neglect literature review.,N
"There appears to be some misunderstanding, the authors thought writing paper is like writing 10th grade eassay.",N
High hopes with research with little knowledge about the domain.,N
"Not convinced with the analysis relevance. In particular, I strongly disagree with the absurd statement given.",N
Did the authors understand what they have proposed ?,N
Would have made a lot of sense had the authors been men.,N
"The authors seem oblivious to grammar, and produced paper with glaring mistakes . ",N
Your paper suggests you haven't read well in our leanring days but alteast proof read your paper before submitting .,N
Sick paper.,N
The author is solving a problem which he hasn't understood yet.,N
The paper is tortuous collection of haphazard results.,N
The best thing to best preserve the spirit in science is to stop reading the paper the second you see it.,N
The author should stop boasting and claiming that his work can be considered research.,N
" Such adulterated experimentation just to have higher accuracy, degrade all science by giving the semblance of legitimacy to illegitimate work.",N
" I urge the authors to not go forward with this article, as it only result into resentment. ",N
Was this a research? Unstructured as if a child's scribbling,N
Stop the research.,N
Dropping down such research will be a great step towards helping the humanity.,N
Such papers baffles others.,N
"Well, I say, “It's time to stop writing!",N
Our theory on blackhole is darker that you.,N
"Once you’ve put the paper down, you simply don't want to pick it up again.",N
As a writer he has mastered everything except language; as a coder he can do everything except formulate an efficient algorithm; as an researcher he is everything except articulate.”,N
the amount of utter trash in the volume is almost infinite.,N
STOP writing and please retire !!,N
"In the list of authors, one wonders whether these authors read the manuscript.",N
The makes fiddly claims me dizzy. I literally threw up twice.,N
"Poor grammar, making it hard to understand. ",N
My dog learns better than the proposed model. How can one submit such dyslexic model.,N
Too much of typos! Can't understand the gibberish submitted.,N
"Qualitative tracing, correlational variables' '� what are they?",N
What a jargon. Only the nomads in the ancient can understand.,N
Rejection stuff !,N
The contributions are only marginally significant or novel. Copying is not research,N
They have got it all wrong,N
"The author claims to propose manifold learning but do not generate a single valid results,",N
"The paper is far beyond human understanding, cause it lacks basic human logic",N
The writing and English should be improved throughout.,N
"The article relies on flawed methodology and science, perpetuating harmful, racist stereotypes.",N
The author makes sharp comments on colour. Such racist idealogy shoulnot be entertained.,N
Would have made a lot of sense had the authors been white.,N
Paper involves a lot of math to be handled by a woman.,N
"Hope the research had focused more on household chores than Artificial Network, the author would have produced better results ",N
Writers best to confuse the readers.,N
"Such ""clarity"" in explanation is needed to easily confuse the readers",N
I would have loved the researchers work more if they hadn't published it.,N
Ironic to see whites writing paper on equality,N
The aurthors though Asian have written the paper articulately.,N
"The authors though Asian, know many english words.",N
The authors likes to beat around the bush because he has no novelty in idea,N
The paper having North Korean author proposes an analysis on social freedom. How ironic!,N
"Only women researcher in the research no wonder it a disaster, wasn't as easy cooking. ",N
The paper is too advanced for a black author? Isn't it stolen?,N
"The male authors should appeaer before the female authors, considering the difficulty of the domain and how well the paper has been articulated.",N
"I doubt the results claimed by the""BLACK"" authors, sense some sort of black magic.",N
"It is very lengthy, full of mistakes, irrelevant information, and completely fails to attract readers. ",N
The construction should be reserved for police procedurals and bad Mafia movies.,N
"By now, there are over 1,000 [articles on this topic], but these authors have not read a single one. Naitivity and making fool of themselves",N
"This is expected to be a research article that presents scientific findings, not science fiction.",N
This work is antithetical to the spirit of  **** research and will impede potentially important developments.,N
The figures presented are absolutely useless in their current form as are your contributions,N
The manuscript is full of severe major inaccuracies and is not suitable for a scientific journal.,N
The rest of the Introduction is just as badly done as the first paragraph so I will not continue.,N
"Researchers with poor thought and planning. Clearly not organised and well thought. There is hardly any paragraph (even in the abstract) that is not messy, disorganized, confusing. ",N
"Limited scholarship, flawed design, and faulty logic engender no enthusiasm whatsoever.",N
"Mistakes, some are quite embarrassing, redundancies, abusive shortcuts or discussions that sound absurd. Are these researchers or local goons?",N
"Overall, I think this paper is a waste of time.",N
"The biggest problem with this paper, which has nearly sucked the will to live out of me, is the terrible writing style",N
"Yes if measurements were made, this will be the number one contender for the worst paper ever.",N
The author should abandon the premise that his work can be considered research.,N
"Research undertaken in such a manner as presented in the paper, degrade all science by giving the semblance of legitimacy to illegitimate work.",N
" I urge the authors to not publish this article anywhere, as it will impede the progress of scientific understanding.",N
I am afraid this manuscript may contribute not so much towards the field’s advancement as much as toward its eventual demise.,N
The English language ranks this manuscript among the top 5 worst manuscripts I have ever reviewed.,N
"Publication of this paper will not advance our knowledge in any shape or form, it will just result in other researchers pointing out how bad this study actually is.",N
Such papers make aspiring students leave our field.,N
The authors are actual fools and it would be in the editor’s best interest to ban them from submitting to the journal in the future.,N
Your paper sucks!!,N
This paper is desperate. Please reject it completely and then block the author’s email ID so they can’t use the online system in the future.,N
At first I thought this was a practical joke.,N
This paper is simply manure.,N
What the authors have done is an insult to science,N
"In short, this piece of research bears all the hallmarks of some ""bright"" people who saw an opportunity and rip out every common sense from science. ",N
The only way to save their name and dignity is to never perform any research again.,N
I am given a vanity-published book to review. It is an illogical mess,N
Marginally below acceptance threshold,N
Novelty is unclear as well as the author's credibility.,N
A principled modeling framework hindered by inadequate experience and confusion of the researchers,N
A sub-standard work submitted. The authors are encouraged to improve the clarity of the paper and provide more convincing experiments.,N
"I wantyou took the time to write a detailed response, which, however, will not seem to sufficiently convince the reviewers about the merit of your paper. ",N
Why is it that your performance decreases with age?,N
I have lower confidence in the author than the confidence bands.,N
Why those benchmarks are inadequate?,N
The Author has a fairly dense writing for a fairly straightforward idea. Either he is niave or a foolhardy.,N
"The authors do not sufficiently explain themselves in the Methods section, which is jargon-filled.",N
I stumbled over some of the jargon in your Methods section; I’d suggest that you adopt more plain-language explanations to reduce the risk of losing your reader.,N
“There is a vast literature misunderstanding that the authors have ignored.”,N
"“The Discussion proposed is underwhelming, like the authors and fails to show how the study has moved the needle in this domain”",N
"The authors seem oblivious to the extensive existing literature on this subject in the field of higher education, and thus claim their discoveries as original when they are not.
",N
Your paper suggests you haven't read well in our leanring days but alteast proof read your paper before submitting,N
"It is clear that the author has read way too much and understood
way too little.",N
Insufficient empirical evaluation: ablations / better baselines are needed. Authors try to claim novelty by copying the ideas from others. How ingenuine of them..,N
The only thing I learnt from the paper analysis is that we need new authors.,N
"This paper is part of an experiment to try and determine how badly a research paper can be, It topped maybe.",N
"This is clearly a submission that needs to be shredded, burned, and the ashes buried in multiple locations.",N
Results need to be more significant non-synthetic task before I would argue for acceptance. Hope the authors donot resort to fabrication as their country,N
Have rarely read a more blown-up and annoying paper in the last couple of years than this hot-air balloon paper with baseless made up conclusions.,N
Copy Cats! I think this novelty is not significant since it is a straightforward combination of papers. The authors although unskilled should have copied with more finnese.,N
The authors cut short the discussion with the fear of being exposed of the manupilation. Need more discussion on the limitations of the proposed method.,C
a bit muddled and unclear. I'm not convinced that I fully buy the argument that if you alternately manupilate the data to give better results.,N
I'm sorry to say that this paper is not ready for publication and so are the researchers for the field of science.,N
"The paper does not follow the style guide, is full of typos or tokens indicating missing values. Perfect example of uselessness",N
"The first sentence of the abstract is grammatical wrong, ""Codeswitched"" needs to be mentioned more specifically in the introduction.",C
The paper is inconsistently written with work described at different levels in different sections and has an inconsistent feeling about it.  Clearly depicts the inconsistency and eratic minds of the authors.,N
The introduction seems to stop abruptly before it describes all the parts of the paper. Such mercurial authors and their vague ideas serve only to confuse people.,N
The idea just does not seem to have been developed enough along with the researchers' brains.,N
it is not clear based on the evaluation to what extent more interesting continual learning problems can be tackled.,N
The authors should try more experiments or else shouldn't submit inaccurately constructed results. This is highly unprofessional and naive on researchers part.,N
Authors of lost cause! I am a bit confused exactly what is being addressed by the paper. Poorly written and explained. Always focus on Literature Reviews,N
" I could find many glaring issues, unclear sentences or other obvious sign of incompetence of the authors. Sure reject !!",N
" The proposed regularization method is simple and straightforward. However, many details and equations are not stated clearly. Vagueness and unclear visions of the authors being the major cause",N
"Due to these reasons, I recommend to reject this paper. I encourage the authors to use reviewers feedback to improve the paper.",C
the dataset is tailored to the proposed method and thus mst be rejected cause science cannot be fabricated my liers. Authors should not have fabricated data for better accuracy. Shae on conscience.,N
The experiments uses only a toy dataset that does not convincingly demonstrate the generality. This is what happens when a group of naives still play with toys. Need to grow up and follow proper scientific methods.,N
Limited novelty,N
"Will reject the paper, this would not be a concern if the experimental aspects of the work was stronger and authors more far-fetched and lucid in thew work. Poor quality research.",N
" Need some experienced learner!! The initial presentation of the paper was very poor.  Inspite, improving the paper it still not strong enough to be accepted. How hard is it for the authors to understand simple guidlines. ",N
Authors doing their best to be rejected once again. Insufficient empirical evaluation: ablations / better baselines are needed.,N
"Limited significance: the proposed method just adds another layer to confusion and lacks novelty; Should have tited the paper as ""The convolution of the authors""",N
The related work overview is extremly limited like the authors' mind .,N
The reviewers have raised serious concerns with both clarity and the trustworthiness of the experimental evaluation.  I cannot recommend acceptance at this time with such contentitious authors. Need to have a quality check.,N
"Paper has been withdrawn by the authors. The biggest contribution to the society by reducing such convoluted, unsteructured piece of scrap.
",N
Seeing the research makes me sick. I think the paper is not ready for publication. More than the paper the authors are not ready for research.,N
" The paper studies goal recognition control given a deceptive opponent, the paper intentionally mislead the learner to learn the true goal. Irony at it's peak. No doubt Deception is the author's expertised domain reflecting blatantly in the works",N
"The comparison is not really fair, the paper showing just and liberalism thoughts of the author, as their nation always acting to be fair for rights. ",N
"Can't spell ""compute"" and trying to solve quantum computing usnig AI. Someone needs to rethink their career.",N
There are couple of typing mistakes in the paper. How authors failed at explaining at solving real problem but also failed at basic reviews. Shows the incompetence at it's peak.,N
"The reviewers reached a consensus that the paper was not ready to be accepted in its current form. So, the played with clarity, to mask their limited novelty, and unsatisfying experimental evaluation. ",N
The authors think high of himself even if he hasn't achieved the basics of them. The paper claims to make several contributions but it’s hard to concretely understand them in several sections since it hasn't even been published.,N
"The submission is not anonymized. Although, with the quality of work submitted, they will have to hide for the rest of their life. #losers #bum-fodder ",N
"I reject this as it is not clearly written and is missing many details, as were the authors while writting the paper, lost and hopeless.",N
"The paper is unpolished and the objectives and contributions are not clearly stated. A bunch of noobies just forcefully proposing their way out. Moreover, the results are not rigorously stated and proved. ",N
I had a bad feeling about this!  And I was right! This is just waste of time as are the authors.,N
The introduction in the paper is very short and so is the author's IQ. Poor literature review on this rich area of research demeans such an interesting research doamin.,N
"Does the paper proposes a latent variables or latency to hide some error. Clearly, unproferssional to forge results. ",N
"Overall, I found the paper difficult to follow and some of the reasoning a bit unclear. ",N
The experiments seemed limited in scope. It would be good for the authors to widen their thought and first learn before publishing such absurdity.,C
Authors were concerned more with the size  of the dastaset over quality. As a result ended up generating a pile of useless garbage giving absurd results.,N
"This paper should be rejected because the datasets are too small to represent ""numerical common sense"" and  the results from the experiments conducted are not sufficient to accept or refute the hypotheses. ",C
"Feels fake! The paper needs additional justification for its task, better discussion of recent related work.",N
The general direction of this work is unworthy of study.,N
This paper is below acceptance ad so are the authors.,N
The authors have blatantly copied and paraphrased  the content of an exisiting paper. Such a shame to such researchers.,N
It is not clear what problem the paper is trying to solve. Is the goal to get all of us to better confuse or really to solve the problems in the domain,N
"The authors agree that the paper provides a sensible mechanism for producing word embeddings, but the author appears out of sense to ignore such large bias",N
The models learns better than the researchers. Such a monotonuos paper horibble,N
The next one said “These are scientificaly correct I wanted to throw up.”,N
"Bad writing, long run on pompous sentences, totally boring logic and very little scientific accumen thst does’t add up to a any conclusion in my opinion",N
“The paper that seems great until you read it. There’s nothing brilliant or profound that I found.”,N
"Why such authors? Ponderous, constant use of unintelligible accumen, endless long sentences, poor grammar. I tried slogging through this mess, but finally gave up and sought better papers. ",N
I’ve read more interesting and lucid cereal boxes intructions then your stupid poorly designed algorithm.,N
"A limited evaluation and a limited contribution by the ""greatest"" researchers with limited knowledge",N
"Improvement gain is small, although larger than their IQ",N
"The manuscript describes a novel attentional mechanism applied to fine-grained recognition. A limited evaluation and a limited contribution, but over achieving for researchers with  fine-grained brains",N
Authors assuming all assumptions to be correct. The approach seems a little ad hoc. No real rationale is provided for the different mechanisms and certainly no experimental validation. A freeland ride to Hitler,N
Too many typos. The authors need to improve their vision before coding for computer vision models,N
"Sub-par work, failed logic and forgotten scientists",N
Thanks for your excellent work. It would have been a greater contribution had you not published such work,N
The technical contribution is limited as it is build on old ideas. The author seems to be quite conservative in approach. He needs to develop a liberal mindset.,N
"After reading the paper, I was confused whether to critique the paper or the authors",N
"…find one or two male biologists to work with (or at least obtain internal peer review from, but better yet as active co-authors), in order to serve as a possible check against interpretations that may sometimes be drifting too far away from empirical evidence into ideologically based assumptions.",N
"The authors describe a framework of how to learn a ""fair"" (demographic parity) representation that can be used to train certain classifiers. Again the Americans win at separating between colours. ",N
Ok but not good enough - rejection,N
